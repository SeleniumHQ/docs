The Java Support Package
========================

Working With Colours
--------------------

You will occasionally want to validate the colour of a thing as part of your tests, the problem is that colour definitions on the web are not constant.  Wouldn't it be nice if there was an easy way to compare a hex representation of a colour with an RGB representation of a colour, or an RGBA representation of a colour with a HSLA representation of a colour.

Worry not there is a solution, the Colour class!

First of all you will need to import the colour class

```java
    import org.openqa.selenium.support.Color
```

You can now start creating colour objects, every colour object will need to be created from a string representation of your colour, supported colour representations are:

```java
    private final Color HEX_COLOUR = Color.fromString("#2F7ED8");
    private final Color RGB_COLOUR = Color.fromString("rgb(255, 255, 255)");
    private final Color RGB_COLOUR = Color.fromString("rgb(40%, 20%, 40%)");
    private final Color RGBA_COLOUR = Color.fromString("rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.5)");
    private final Color RGBA_COLOUR = Color.fromString("rgba(40%, 20%, 40%, 0.5)");
    private final Color HSL_COLOUR = Color.fromString("hsl(100, 0%, 50%)");
    private final Color HSLA_COLOUR = Color.fromString("hsla(100, 0%, 50%, 0.5)");
```

The Color package also supports all of the base colour definitions specified at [http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-color/#html4].

```java
    private final Color BLACK = Color.fromString("black");
    private final Color CHOCOLATE = Color.fromString("chocolate");
    private final Color HOTPINK = Color.fromString("hotpink");
```

Sometimes browsers will return a colour value of transparent if no colour has been set on an element, the Color package also supports this

```java
    private final Color TRANSPARENT = Color.fromString("transparent");
```

You can now safely query an element to get its colour/background colour knowing that any response will be correctly parsed and converted into a valid Color object:

```java
    Color loginButtonColour = driver.findElement(By.id("login")).getCssValue("color");
    Color loginButtonBackgroundColour = driver.findElement(By.id("login")).getCssValue("background-color");
```

You can then directly compare colour objects:

```java
    assert loginButtonBackgroundColour.equals(HOTPINK);
```

Or you can convert the colour into one of the following formats and perform a static validation:

```java
    assert loginButtonBackgroundColour.asHex().equals("#ff69b4");
    assert loginButtonBackgroundColour.asRgba().equals("rgba(255, 105, 180, 1)");
    assert loginButtonBackgroundColour.asRgb().equals("rgb(255, 105, 180)");
```

Colours are no longer a problem

Working With <select> Elements
--------------------

Select elements can require quite a bit of boiler plate code to automate, to reduce this and make your tests cleaner there is a Select class in the Selenium support package.  To use it you will need the following import:

```java
    import org.openqa.selenium.support.ui.Select;
```

You are then able to create a Select object using a WebElement that references a <select> element.

```java
    WebElement selectElement = driver.findElement(By.id("selectElementID"));
    Select selectObject = new Select(selectElement);
```

The select object will now give you a series of commands that allow you to interact with a <select> element.  First of all you have some options to select various options from the <select> element.  Here is an example <select> element:

```html
    <!-- The second value will be selected initially -->
    <select name="select">
      <option value="value1">Bread</option>
      <option value="value2" selected>Milk</option>
      <option value="value3">Cheese</option>
    </select>
```

To select the first option from the above <select> element you now have three options:

```java
    //Select an <option> based upon the <select> elements internal index
    selectObject.selectByIndex(1);

    //Select an <option> based upon its value attribute
    selectObject.selectByValue("value1");

    //Select an <option> based upon its text
    selectObject.selectByVisibleText("Bread");
```

You can then check which options are selected by using:

```java
    //Return a WebElement<List> of options that have been selected
    List<WebElement> allSelectedOptions = selectObject.getAllSelectedOptions();

    //Return a WebElement referencing the first selection option found by walking down the DOM
    WebElement firstSelectedOption = selectObject.getFirstSelectedOption();
```

Or you may just be interested in what <option> elements the <select> element contains:

```java
    //Return a WebElement<List> of options that the <select> element contains
    List<WebElement> allAvailableOptions = selectObject.getOptions();
```

If you then want to deselect any elements you now have four options

```java
    //Deselect an <option> based upon the <select> elements internal index
    selectObject.deselectByIndex(1);

    //Deselect an <option> based upon its value attribute
    selectObject.deselectByValue("value1");

    //Deselect an <option> based upon its text
    selectObject.deselectByVisibleText("Bread");

    //Deselect all selected <option> elements
    selectObject.deselectAll();
```
Finally, some <select> elements allow you to select more than one option, you can find out if your <select> element is one of these by using:

```java
    Boolean doesThisAllowMultipleSelections = selectObject.isMultiple();
```

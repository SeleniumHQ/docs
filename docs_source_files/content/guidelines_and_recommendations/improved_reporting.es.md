Selenium is not designed to report on the status of test cases
run. Taking advantage of the built-in reporting capabilities of unit
test frameworks is a good start.  Most unit test frameworks have
reports that can generate xUnit or HTML formatted reports.  xUnit
reports are popular for importing results to a Continuous Integration
(CI) server like Jenkins, Travis, Bamboo, etc.  Here are some links
for more information regarding report outputs for several languages.

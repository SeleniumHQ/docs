The server will always run on the machine with the browser you want to
test. The server can be used either from the command line or through code
configuration.


## Starting the server from the command line

Once you have downloaded `selenium-server-standalone-{VERSION}.jar`,
place it on the computer with the browser you want to test. Then, from
the directory with the jar, run the following:

```shell
java -jar selenium-server-standalone-{VERSION}.jar
```

## Considerations for running the server

The caller is expected to terminate each session properly, calling
either `Selenium#stop()` or `WebDriver#quit`.

The selenium-server keeps in-memory logs for each ongoing session,
which are cleared when `Selenium#stop()` or `WebDriver#quit` is called. If
you forget to terminate these sessions, your server may leak memory. If
you keep extremely long-running sessions, you will probably need to
stop/quit every now and then (or increase memory with -Xmx jvm option).


## Timeouts (from version 2.21)

The server has two different timeouts, which can be set as follows:

```shell
java -jar selenium-server-standalone-{VERSION}.jar -timeout=20 -browserTimeout=60
```

* browserTimeout
  * Controls how long the browser is allowed to hang (value in seconds).
* timeout
  * Controls how long the client is allowed to be gone
  before the session is reclaimed (value in seconds).

The system property `selenium.server.session.timeout`
is no longer supported as of 2.21.

Please note that the `browserTimeout`
is intended as a backup timeout mechanism
when the ordinary timeout mechanism fails,
which should be used mostly in grid/server environments
to ensure that crashed/lost processes do not stay around for too long,
polluting the runtime environment.


## Configuring the server programmatically

In theory, the process is as simple as mapping the `DriverServlet` to
a URL, but it's also possible to host the page in a lightweight
container, such as Jetty configured entirely in code. Steps to do this
follow.

Download the `selenium-server.zip` and unpack. Put the JARs on the
CLASSPATH. Create a new class called `AppServer`. Here, I'm using
Jetty, so you'll need to [download](//www.eclipse.org/jetty/download.html)
that as well:

```java
import org.mortbay.jetty.Connector;
import org.mortbay.jetty.Server;
import org.mortbay.jetty.nio.SelectChannelConnector;
import org.mortbay.jetty.security.SslSocketConnector;
import org.mortbay.jetty.webapp.WebAppContext;

import javax.servlet.Servlet;
import java.io.File;

import org.openqa.selenium.remote.server.DriverServlet;

public class AppServer {
  private Server server = new Server();

  public AppServer() throws Exception {
    WebAppContext context = new WebAppContext();
    context.setContextPath("");
    context.setWar(new File("."));
    server.addHandler(context);

    context.addServlet(DriverServlet.class, "/wd/*");

    SelectChannelConnector connector = new SelectChannelConnector();
    connector.setPort(3001);
    server.addConnector(connector);

    server.start();
  }
}
```

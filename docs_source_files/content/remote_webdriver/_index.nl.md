# Remote WebDriver

You can use WebDriver remotely the same way you would use it
locally. The primary difference is that a remote WebDriver needs to be
configured so that it can run your tests on a separate machine.

A remote WebDriver is composed of two pieces: a client and a
server. The client is your WebDriver test and the server is simply a
Java servlet, which can be hosted in any modern JEE app server.

Selenium can be extended through the use of plugins. Here are a number of
plugins created and maintained by third parties. For more information on how
to create your own plugin or have it listed, consult the docs.

Please note that these plugins are not supported, maintained, hosted, or
endorsed by the Selenium project. In addition, be advised that the plugins
listed below are not necessarily licensed under the Apache License v.2.0.
Some of the plugins are available under another free and open source software
license; others are only available under a proprietary license. Any questions
about plugins and their license of distribution need to be raised with their
respective developer(s).

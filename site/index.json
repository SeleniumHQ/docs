	"content": " Installing Selenium libraries First you need to install the Selenium bindings for your automation project. The installation process for libraries depends on the language you choose to use.\nJava Installation of Selenium libraries for Java can be done using Maven. Add the selenium-java dependency in your project pom.xml:\n\u0026lt;dependency\u0026gt; \u0026lt;groupId\u0026gt;org.seleniumhq.selenium\u0026lt;/groupId\u0026gt; \u0026lt;artifactId\u0026gt;selenium-java\u0026lt;/artifactId\u0026gt; \u0026lt;version\u0026gt;3.X\u0026lt;/version\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/dependency\u0026gt; The selenium-java dependency supports running your automation project with all Selenium supported browsers. If you want to run tests only in a specific browser, you can add the dependency for that browser in your pom.xml file. For example, you should add following dependency in your pom.xml file to run your tests only in Firefox:\n\u0026lt;dependency\u0026gt; \u0026lt;groupId\u0026gt;org.seleniumhq.selenium\u0026lt;/groupId\u0026gt; \u0026lt;artifactId\u0026gt;selenium-firefox-driver\u0026lt;/artifactId\u0026gt; \u0026lt;version\u0026gt;3.X\u0026lt;/version\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/dependency\u0026gt; In a similar manner, if you want to run tests only in Chrome, you should add the following dependency:\n\u0026lt;dependency\u0026gt; \u0026lt;groupId\u0026gt;org.seleniumhq.selenium\u0026lt;/groupId\u0026gt; \u0026lt;artifactId\u0026gt;selenium-chrome-driver\u0026lt;/artifactId\u0026gt; \u0026lt;version\u0026gt;3.X\u0026lt;/version\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/dependency\u0026gt; Python Installation of Selenium libraries for Python can be done using pip:\npip install selenium Alternatively you can download the PyPI source archive (selenium-x.x.x.tar.gz) and install it using setup.py:\npython setup.py install C Installation of Selenium libraries for C# can be done using NuGet:\n# Using package manager Install-Package Selenium.WebDriver # or using .Net CLI dotnet add package Selenium.WebDriver Ruby Installation of Selenium libraries for Ruby can be done using gem:\ngem install selenium-webdriver JavaScript Installation of Selenium libraries for JavaScript can be done using npm:\nnpm install selenium-webdriver"

	"description": "",
	"content": " Page Object is a Design Pattern which has become popular in test automation for enhancing test maintenance and reducing code duplication. A page object is an object-oriented class that serves as an interface to a page of your AUT. The tests then use the methods of this page object class whenever they need to interact with that page of the UI. The benefit is that if the UI changes for the page, the tests themselves don’t need to change; only the code within the page object needs to change. Subsequently, all changes to support that new UI are located in one place.\nThe Page Object Design Pattern provides the following advantage: there is clean separation between test code and page specific code such as locators (or their use if you’re using a UI map) and layout.\nPage object methods should return a value  If you submit a page and are redirected, it should return the new page object. If you click submit on login and you want to check to see if a user is logged in, it should return True or False in a method.  "

	"content": " Selenium is not just one tool or API but it composes many tools.\nWebDriver WebDriver is also known as Selenium 2. If you are beginning with desktop website test automation then you are going to be using WebDriver APIs. WebDriver uses browser automation APIs provided by browser vendors to control browser and run tests. This is as if a real user is operating the browser. Since WebDriver does not require its API to be compiled with application code, it is not intrusive in nature. Hence, you are testing the same application which you push live.\nRemote Control Remote Control is also known as Selenium 1. Selenium RC was the most prominent Selenium tool before the advent of Selenium WebDriver. Selenium RC would use a proxy server and inject JavaScript into a browser to be able to control it. Given the intrusive nature Selenium RC had on a browser, you could never be sure if what you were testing was the same as the application you wanted to push live. Selenium 2 APIs yet contain Selenium RC APIs but Selenium 3 would completely get rid of Selenium RC APIs. If you are still using Selenium RC then you must migrate to Selenium WebDriver.\nIDE IDE is a Firefox plugin which can be used to record test steps in Firefox itself. Selenium IDE can be used to generate quick and dirty test code in a variety of programming languages (i.e. C#, Java, Python, and Ruby). Given the maintainability of code generated through Selenium IDE, it is not recommended to use it for anything more than getting acquainted with element locators or generating throw away code. We\u0026rsquo;re sure that once you get used to the WebDriver API, you will never use Selenium IDE.\nGrid Soon after development of WebDriver tests, you may face a need of running your tests on multiple browser and operating system combinations. This is where Grid comes to the rescue.\nHTML Runner This tool allows you to run Test Suites from the command line. Test Suites are HTML exports from Selenium IDE or compatible tools. HTML Runner\n"

	"content": " The server will always run on the machine with the browser you want to test. The server can be used either from the command line or through code configuration.\nStarting the server from the command line Once you have downloaded selenium-server-standalone-{VERSION}.jar, place it on the computer with the browser you want to test. Then, from the directory with the jar, run the following:\njava -jar selenium-server-standalone-{VERSION}.jar Considerations for running the server The caller is expected to terminate each session properly, calling either Selenium#stop() or WebDriver#quit.\nThe selenium-server keeps in-memory logs for each ongoing session, which are cleared when Selenium#stop() or WebDriver#quit is called. If you forget to terminate these sessions, your server may leak memory. If you keep extremely long-running sessions, you will probably need to stop/quit every now and then (or increase memory with -Xmx jvm option).\nTimeouts (from version 2.21) The server has two different timeouts, which can be set as follows:\njava -jar selenium-server-standalone-{VERSION}.jar -timeout=20 -browserTimeout=60  browserTimeout  Controls how long the browser is allowed to hang (value in seconds).  timeout  Controls how long the client is allowed to be gone before the session is reclaimed (value in seconds).   The system property selenium.server.session.timeout is no longer supported as of 2.21.\nPlease note that the browserTimeout is intended as a backup timeout mechanism when the ordinary timeout mechanism fails, which should be used mostly in grid/server environments to ensure that crashed/lost processes do not stay around for too long, polluting the runtime environment.\nConfiguring the server programmatically In theory, the process is as simple as mapping the DriverServlet to a URL, but it\u0026rsquo;s also possible to host the page in a lightweight container, such as Jetty configured entirely in code. Steps to do this follow.\nDownload the selenium-server.zip and unpack. Put the JARs on the CLASSPATH. Create a new class called AppServer. Here, I\u0026rsquo;m using Jetty, so you\u0026rsquo;ll need to download that as well:\nimport org.mortbay.jetty.Connector; import org.mortbay.jetty.Server; import org.mortbay.jetty.nio.SelectChannelConnector; import org.mortbay.jetty.security.SslSocketConnector; import org.mortbay.jetty.webapp.WebAppContext; import javax.servlet.Servlet; import java.io.File; import org.openqa.selenium.remote.server.DriverServlet; public class AppServer { private Server server = new Server(); public AppServer() throws Exception { WebAppContext context = new WebAppContext(); context.setContextPath(\u0026#34;\u0026#34;); context.setWar(new File(\u0026#34;.\u0026#34;)); server.addHandler(context); context.addServlet(DriverServlet.class, \u0026#34;/wd/*\u0026#34;); SelectChannelConnector connector = new SelectChannelConnector(); connector.setPort(3001); server.addConnector(connector); server.start(); } }"

	"content": " Selenium controls web browsers Selenium is many things, but at its core it\u0026rsquo;s a toolset for web browser automation that uses the best techniques available to remotely control browser instances and emulate a user\u0026rsquo;s interaction with the browser.\nIt allows users to simulate common activities performed by end-users; entering text into fields, selecting drop-down values and checking boxes, and clicking links in documents. It also provides many other controls such as mouse movement, arbitrary JavaScript execution, and much more.\nAlthough used primarily for front-end testing of websites, Selenium is at its core a browser user agent library. The interfaces are ubiquitous to their application, which encourages composition with other libraries to suit your purpose.\nOne interface to rule them all One of the project\u0026rsquo;s guiding principles is to support a common interface for all (major) browser technologies. Web browsers are incredibly complex, highly engineered applications, performing their operations in completely different ways but which frequently look the same while doing so. Even though the text is rendered in the same fonts, the images are displayed in the same place and the links take you to the same destination. What is happening underneath is as different as night and day. Selenium “abstracts” these differences, hiding their details and intricacies from the person writing the code. This allows you to write several lines of code to perform a complicated workflow, but these same lines will execute on Firefox, Internet Explorer, Chrome, and all other supported browsers.\nTools and support Selenium\u0026rsquo;s minimalist design approach gives it versatility to be included as a component in bigger applications. The surrounding infrastructure provided under the Selenium umbrella gives you the tools to put together your own grid of browsers so tests can be run on different browsers and multiple operating systems across a range of machines.\nImagine a bank of computers in your server room or data centre all firing up browsers at the same time hitting your site\u0026rsquo;s links, forms, and tables\u0026mdash;testing your application 24 hours a day. Through the simple programming interface provided for the most common languages, these tests will run tirelessly in parallel, reporting back to you when errors occur.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s an aim to help make this a reality for you, by providing users with tools and documentation to not only control browsers, but to make it easy to scale and deploy such grids.\nWho uses Selenium Many of the most important companies in the world have adopted Selenium for their browser-based testing, often replacing years-long efforts involving other proprietary tools. As it has grown in popularity, so have its requirements and challenges multiplied.\nAs the web becomes more complicated and new technologies are added to websites, it\u0026rsquo;s the mission of this project to keep up with them where possible. Being an open source project, this support is provided through the generous donation of time from many volunteers, every one of which has a “day job”.\nAnother mission of the project is to encourage more volunteers to partake in this effort, and build a strong community so that the project can continue to keep up with emerging technologies and remain a dominant platform for functional test automation.\nHistory When Selenium 1 was released in 2004, it was out of the necessity to reduce time spent manually verifying consistent behaviour in the front-end of a web application. It made use of what tools were available at the time, and relied heavily on the injection of JavaScript to the web page under test to emulate a user\u0026rsquo;s interaction.\nWhilst JavaScript is a good tool to let you introspect the properties of the DOM and to do certain client-side observations that you would otherwise not be able to do, it falls short on the ability to naturally replicate a user\u0026rsquo;s interactions as if the mouse and keyboard are being used.\nSince then, Selenium has grown and matured a lot, into a tool widely used by many\u0026mdash;if not most\u0026mdash;of the largest organisations around the world. Selenium has gone from a homebrewed test automation toolkit developed at Thoughtworks for a niché audience and a specific use case, to the world\u0026rsquo;s de facto browser automation library.\nJust as Selenium RC made use of the tools of the trade available at the time, Selenium WebDriver drives that tradition on by taking the browser interaction part to the browser vendor\u0026rsquo;s home turf, and asking them to take responsibility of the backend, browser-facing implementations. Recently this work has evolved into a W3C standardisation process where the goal is to turn the WebDriver component in Selenium into the du jeur remote control library for user agents.\n"

	"content": " Building a test suite using WebDriver will require you to understand and effectively use a number of different components. As with everything in software, different people use different terms for the same idea. Below is a breakdown of how terms are used in this description.\nTerminology  API: Application Programming Interface. This is the set of \u0026ldquo;commands\u0026rdquo; you use to manipulate WebDriver. Library: A code module which contains the APIs and the code necessary to implement them. Libraries are specific to each language binding, eg .jar files for Java, .dll files for .NET, etc. Driver: Responsible for controlling the actual browser. Most drivers are created by the browser vendors themselves. Drivers are generally executable modules that run on the system with the browser itself, not on the system executing the test suite. (Although those may be the same system.) NOTE: Some people refer to the drivers as proxies. Framework: An additional library used as a support for WebDriver suites. These frameworks may be test frameworks such as JUnit or NUnit. They may also be frameworks supporting natural language features such as Cucumber or Robotium. Frameworks may also be written and used for things such as manipulating or configuring the system under test, data creation, test oracles, etc.  The Parts and Pieces At its minimum, WebDriver talks to a browser through a driver. Communication is two way: WebDriver passes commands to the browser through the driver, and receives information back via the same route.\nThe driver is specific to the browser, such as ChromeDriver for Google\u0026rsquo;s Chrome/Chromium, GeckoDriver for Mozilla\u0026rsquo;s Firefox, etc. The driver runs on the same system as the browser. This may, or may not be, the same system where the tests themselves are executing.\nThis simple example above is direct communication. Communication to the browser may also be remote communication through Selenium Server or RemoteWebDriver. RemoteWebDriver runs on the same system as the driver and the browser.\nRemote communication can also take place using Selenium Server or Selenium Grid, both of which in turn talk to the driver on the host system\nWhere Frameworks fit in WebDriver has one job and one job only: communicate with the browser via any of the methods above. WebDriver doesn\u0026rsquo;t know a thing about testing: it doesn\u0026rsquo;t know how to compare things, assert pass or fail, and it certainly doesn\u0026rsquo;t know a thing about reporting or Given/When/Then grammar.\nThis is where various frameworks come in to play. At a minimum you\u0026rsquo;ll need a test framework that matches the language bindings, eg NUnit for .NET, JUnit for Java, RSpec for Ruby, etc.\nThe test framework is responsible for running and executing your WebDriver and related steps in your tests. As such, you can think of it looking akin to the following image.\nNatural language frameworks/tools such as Cucumber may exist as part of that Test Framework box in the figure above, or they may wrap the Test Framework entirely in their own implementation.\n"

	"description": "",
	"content": " A domain specific language (DSL) is a system which provides the user with an expressive means of solving a problem. It allows a user to interact with the system on their terms – not just programmer-speak.\nYour users, in general, don\u0026rsquo;t care how your site looks. They don\u0026rsquo;t care about the decoration, animations, or graphics. They want to use your system to push their new employees through the process with minimal difficulty. They want to book travel to Alaska. They want to configure and buy unicorns at a discount. Your job as the tester is to come as close as you can to “capturing” this mind-set. With that in mind, we set about “modeling” the application you\u0026rsquo;re working on, such that the test scripts (the user\u0026rsquo;s only pre-release proxy) “speak” for and represent the user.\nWith Selenium, DSL is usually represented by methods, written to make the API simple and readable – they enable a report between the developers and the stakeholders (users, product owners, business intelligence specialists, etc.).\nBenefits  Readable: Business stakeholders can understand it. Writable: Easy to write, avoids unnecessary duplication. Extensible: Functionality can (reasonably) be added without breaking contracts and existing functionality. Maintainable: By leaving the implementation details out of test cases, you are well-insulated against changes to the AUT (application under test).  Java Here is an example of a reasonable DSL method in Java. For brevity\u0026rsquo;s sake, it assumes the driver object is pre-defined and available to the method.\n/** * Takes a username and password, fills out the fields, and clicks \u0026#34;login\u0026#34;. * @return An instance of the AccountPage */ public AccountPage loginAsUser(String username, String password) { WebElement loginField = driver.findElement(By.id(\u0026#34;loginField\u0026#34;)); loginField.clear(); loginField.sendKeys(username); // Fill out the password field. The locator we\u0026#39;re using is \u0026#34;By.id\u0026#34;, and we should  // have it defined elsewhere in the class.  WebElement passwordField = driver.findElement(By.id(\u0026#34;password\u0026#34;)); passwordField.clear(); passwordField.sendKeys(password); // Click the login button, which happens to have the id \u0026#34;submit\u0026#34;.  driver.findElement(By.id(\u0026#34;submit\u0026#34;)).click(); // Create and return a new instance of the AccountPage (via the built-in Selenium  // PageFactory).  return PageFactory.newInstance(AccountPage.class); } This method completely abstracts the concepts of input fields, buttons, clicking, and even pages from your test code. Using this approach, all your tester has to do is call this method. This gives you a maintenance advantage: if the login fields ever changed, you would only ever have to change this method - not your tests.\npublic void loginTest() { loginAsUser(\u0026#34;cbrown\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;cl0wn3\u0026#34;); // Now that we\u0026#39;re logged in, do some other stuff--since we used a DSL to support  // our testers, it\u0026#39;s as easy as choosing from available methods.  do.something(); do.somethingElse(); Assert.assertTrue(\u0026#34;Something should have been done!\u0026#34;, something.wasDone()); // Note that we still haven\u0026#39;t referred to a button or web control anywhere in this  // script... } It bears repeating: one of your primary goals should be writing an API that allows your tests to address the problem at hand, and NOT the problem of the UI. The UI is a secondary concern for your users – they don\u0026rsquo;t care about the UI, they just want to get their job done. Your test scripts should read like a laundry list of things the user wants to DO, and the things they want to KNOW. The tests should not concern themselves with HOW the UI requires you to go about it.\n"

	"content": " Through WebDriver, Selenium supports all major browsers on the market such as Chrom(ium), Firefox, Internet Explorer, Opera, and Safari. Where possible, WebDriver drives the browser using the browser\u0026rsquo;s built-in support for automation, although not all browsers have official support for remote control.\nWebDriver\u0026rsquo;s aim is to emulate a real user\u0026rsquo;s interaction with the browser as closely as possible. This is possible at varying levels in different browsers. For more details on the different driver idiosyncracies, please see Driver Idiosyncracies.\nEven though all the drivers share a single user-facing interface for controlling the browser, they have slightly different ways of setting up browser sessions. Since many of the driver implementations are provided by third parties, they are not included in the standard Selenium distribution.\nDriver instantiation, profile management, and various browser specific settings are examples of parameters that have different requirements depending on the browser. This section explains the basic requirements for getting you started with the different browsers.\nAdding Executables to your PATH Most drivers require an extra executable for Selenium to communicate with the browser. You can manually specify where the executable lives before starting WebDriver, but this can make your tests less portable, as the executables will need to be in the same place on every machine, or included within your test code repository.\nBy adding a folder containing WebDriver\u0026rsquo;s binaries to your system\u0026rsquo;s path, Selenium will be able to locate the additional binaries without requiring your test code to locate the exact location of the driver.\n Create a directory to place the executables in, like C:\\WebDriver\\bin or /opt/WebDriver/bin Add the directory to your PATH:\n On Windows - Open a command prompt as administrator and the run the following command to permanently add the directory to your path for all users on your machine:\nsetx /m path \u0026#34;%path%;C:\\WebDriver\\bin\\\u0026#34; Bash users on macOS and Linux - In a terminal:\nexport PATH=$PATH:/opt/WebDriver/bin \u0026gt;\u0026gt; ~/.profile  You are now ready to test your changes. Close all open command prompts and open a new one. Type out the name of one of the binaries in the folder you created in the previous step, e.g:\nchromedriver If your PATH is configured correctly, you will see some some output relating to the startup of the driver:\nStarting ChromeDriver 2.25.426935 (820a95b0b81d33e42712f9198c215f703412e1a1) on port 9515 Only local connections are allowed.  You can regain control of your command prompt by pressing Ctrl + C\nQuick reference    Browser Supported OS Maintained by Download Issue Tracker     Chromium/Chrome Windows/macOS/Linux Google Downloads Issues   Firefox Windows/macOS/Linux Mozilla Downloads Issues   Edge Windows 10 Microsoft Downloads Issues   Internet Explorer Windows Selenium Project Downloads Issues   Safari macOS El Capitan and newer Apple Built in Issues   Opera Windows/macOS/Linux Opera Downloads Issues    Chromium/Chrome To drive Chrome or Chromium, you have to download chromedriver and put it in a folder that is on your system\u0026rsquo;s path.\nOn Linux or macOS, this means modifying the PATH environmental variable. You can see what directories, separated by a colon, make up your system\u0026rsquo;s path by executing the following command:\n$ echo $PATH /usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin To include chromedriver on the path if it isn\u0026rsquo;t already, make sure you include the chromedriver binary\u0026rsquo;s parent directory. The following line will set the PATH environmental variable its current content, plus an additional path added after the colon:\n$ export PATH=\u0026#34;$PATH:/path/to/chromedriver\u0026#34; When chromedriver is available on your path, you should be able to execute the chromedriver executable from any directory.\nTo instantiate a Chrome/Chromium session, you can do the following:\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript import org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver; import org.openqa.selenium.chrome.ChromeDriver; WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();   #Simple assignment from selenium.webdriver import Chrome driver = Chrome() #Or use the context manager from selenium.webdriver import Chrome with Chrome() as driver: #your code inside this indent   using OpenQA.Selenium; using OpenQA.Selenium.Chrome; IWebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();   require \u0026#34;selenium-webdriver\u0026#34; driver = Selenium::WebDriver.for :chrome   const {Builder} = require(\u0026#39;selenium-webdriver\u0026#39;); const chrome = require(\u0026#39;selenium-webdriver/chrome\u0026#39;); (async function myFunction() { let driver = await new Builder().forBrowser(\u0026#39;chrome\u0026#39;).build(); //your code inside this block })();     Remember that you have to set the path to the chromedriver executable. This is possible using the following line:\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript System.setProperty(\u0026#34;webdriver.chrome.driver\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;/path/to/chromedriver\u0026#34;);   Chrome(executable_path=\u0026#39;/path/to/chromedriver\u0026#39;)   new ChromeDriver(\u0026#34;/path/to/chromedriver\u0026#34;);   Selenium::WebDriver::Chrome.driver_path = \u0026#34;/path/to/chromedriver\u0026#34;   chrome.setDefaultService(new chrome.ServiceBuilder(\u0026#39;path/to/chromedriver\u0026#39;).build());     The chromedriver is implemented as a WebDriver remote server that by exposing Chrome\u0026rsquo;s internal automation proxy interface instructs the browser what to do.\nFirefox Starting with Selenium 3, Mozilla has taken over implementation of Firefox Driver, with geckodriver. The new driver for Firefox is called geckodriver and works with Firefox 48 and newer. Since the Firefox WebDriver is under development, the newer the Firefox version the better the support.\nAs geckodriver is the new default way of launching Firefox, you can instantiate Firefox in the same way as Selenium 2:\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript import org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver; import org.openqa.selenium.Firefox.FirefoxDriver; WebDriver driver = new FirefoxDriver();   #Simple assignment from selenium.webdriver import Firefox driver = Firefox() #Or use the context manager from selenium.webdriver import Firefox with Firefox() as driver: #your code inside this indent   using OpenQA.Selenium; using OpenQA.Selenium.Firefox; IWebDriver driver = new FirefoxDriver();   require \u0026#34;selenium-webdriver\u0026#34; driver = Selenium::WebDriver.for :firefox   const {Builder} = require(\u0026#39;selenium-webdriver\u0026#39;); (async function myFunction() { let driver = await new Builder().forBrowser(\u0026#39;firefox\u0026#39;).build(); //your code inside this block })();     If you prefer not to set geckodriver\u0026rsquo;s location using PATH, set the geckodriver binary location programmatically:\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript System.setProperty(\u0026#34;webdriver.gecko.driver\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;/path/to/geckodriver\u0026#34;);   Firefox(executable_path=\u0026#39;/path/to/geckodriver\u0026#39;)   new FirefoxDriver(\u0026#34;/path/to/geckodriver\u0026#34;);   Selenium::WebDriver::Firefox.driver_path = \u0026#34;/path/to/geckodriver\u0026#34;   // We don\u0026#39;t have a JavaScript code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR      It is also possible to set the property at run time:\nmvn test -Dwebdriver.gecko.driver=/path/to/geckodriver It is currently possible to revert to the older, more feature complete Firefox driver, by installing Firefox 47.0.1 or 45 ESR and specifying a desired capability of marionette as false. Later releases of Firefox are no longer compatible.\nEdge Edge is Microsoft\u0026rsquo;s newest browser, included with Windows 10 and Server 2016. Updates to Edge are bundled with major Windows updates, so you\u0026rsquo;ll need to download a binary which matches the build number of your currently installed build of Windows. The Edge Developer site contains links to all the available binaries. Bugs against the EdgeDriver implementation can be raised with Microsoft. If you\u0026rsquo;d like to run tests against Edge, but aren\u0026rsquo;t running Windows 10, Microsoft offer free VMs for testers on the Edge Developer site.\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript import org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver; import org.openqa.selenium.edge.EdgeDriver; WebDriver driver = new EdgeDriver();   #Simple assignment from selenium.webdriver import Edge driver = Edge() #Or use the context manager from selenium.webdriver import Edge with Edge() as driver: #your code inside this indent   using OpenQA.Selenium; using OpenQA.Selenium.Edge; IWebDriver driver = new EdgeDriver();   require \u0026#34;selenium-webdriver\u0026#34; driver = Selenium::WebDriver.for :edge   const {Builder} = require(\u0026#39;selenium-webdriver\u0026#39;); (async function myFunction() { let driver = await new Builder().forBrowser(\u0026#39;MicrosoftEdge\u0026#39;).build(); //your code inside this block })();     If Edge driver is not present in your path, you can set the path using the following line:\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript System.setProperty(\u0026#34;webdriver.edge.driver\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;C:/path/to/MicrosoftWebDriver.exe\u0026#34;);   Edge(executable_path=\u0026#39;/path/to/MicrosoftWebDriver.exe\u0026#39;)   new EdgeDriver(\u0026#34;/path/to/MicrosoftWebDriver.exe\u0026#34;);   Selenium::WebDriver::Edge.driver_path = \u0026#34;C:\\path\\to\\MicrosoftWebDriver.exe\u0026#34;   // We don\u0026#39;t have a JavaScript code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR      Internet Explorer Internet Explorer was Microsoft\u0026rsquo;s default browser until Windows 10, although it is still included in Windows 10. Internet Explorer Driver is the only driver The Selenium project aims to support the same releases Microsoft considers current. Older releases may work, but will be unsupported.\nWhile the Selenium project provides binaries for both the 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Internet Explorer, there are some limitations with Internet Explorer 10 \u0026amp; 11 with the 64-bit driver, but using the 32-bit driver continues to work well.

It has not been updated since 2014 and is based of a draft version of the W3 specification. Jim Evans has an excellent writeup on Microsoft\u0026rsquo;s implementation.\nOpera Current releases of Opera are built on top of the Chromium engine, and WebDriver is now supported via the closed-source Opera Chromium Driver, which can be added to your PATH or as a system property.\nInstantiating a driver session is similar to Firefox and Chromium:\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript import org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver; import org.openqa.selenium.opera.OperaDriver; WebDriver driver = new OperaDriver();   #Simple assignment from selenium.webdriver import Opera driver = Opera() #Or use the context manager from selenium.webdriver import Opera with Opera() as driver: #your code inside this indent   using OpenQA.Selenium; using OpenQA.Selenium.Opera; IWebDriver driver = new OperaDriver();   require \u0026#34;selenium-webdriver\u0026#34; driver = Selenium::WebDriver.for :opera   // We don\u0026#39;t have a JavaScript code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR      Safari Starting with Safari 10 on macOS El Capitan and Sierra, WebDriver support is included with each release of the browser. To enable support:\n Enable the Developer menu from Safari preferences Check the Allow Remote Automation option from with the Develop menu Run the following command from the terminal for the first time and type your password at the prompt to authorise WebDriver\n/usr/bin/safaridriver -p 1337\u0026lt;/  You can then start a driver session using:\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript import org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver; import org.openqa.selenium.safari.SafariDriver; WebDriver driver = new SafariDriver();   #Simple assignment from selenium.webdriver import Safari driver = Safari() #Or use the context manager from selenium.webdriver import Safari with Safari() as driver: #your code inside this indent   using OpenQA.Selenium; using OpenQA.Selenium.Safari; IWebDriver driver = new SafariDriver();   require \u0026#34;selenium-webdriver\u0026#34; driver = Selenium::WebDriver.for :safari   const {Builder} = require(\u0026#39;selenium-webdriver\u0026#39;); (async function myFunction() { let driver = await new Builder().forBrowser(\u0026#39;safari\u0026#39;).build(); //your code inside this block })();     Those looking to automate Safari on iOS should look to the Appium project. Whilst Safari was previously available for Windows, Apple has long since dropped support, making it a poor choice of test platform.\nMock browsers HtmlUnit HtmlUnit is a \u0026ldquo;GUI-Less browser for Java programs\u0026rdquo;. It models HTML documents and provides an API that allows you to invoke pages, fill out forms, click links, etc. It has JavaScript support and is able to work with AJAX libraries, simulating Chrome, Firefox or Internet Explorer depending on the configuration used. It has been moved to a new location. The source is maintained on svn.\nPhantomJS PhantomJS is a headless browser based on Webkit, albeit a version much older than that used by Google Chrome or Safari. Whilst historically a popular choice, it would now be wise to avoid PhantomJS. The project has been unmaintained since the 5th of August, so whilst the web will continue to change, PhantomJS will not be updated. This was after Google announced the ability to run Chrome headlessly, something also now offered by Mozilla\u0026rsquo;s Firefox.\n"

	"content": " First, start by asking yourself whether or not you really need to use a browser. Odds are good that, at some point, if you\u0026rsquo;re working on a complex web application, you will need to open a browser and actually test it.\nFunctional end-user tests such as Selenium tests are expensive to run, however. Furthermore, they typically require substantial infrastructure to be in place to be run effectively. It\u0026rsquo;s a good rule to always ask yourself if what you want to test can be done using more lightweight test approaches such as unit tests or with a lower-level approach.\nOnce you have made the determination that you\u0026rsquo;re in the web browser testing business, and you have your Selenium environment ready to begin writing tests, you will generally perform some combination of three steps:\n Set up the data Perform a discrete set of actions Evaluate the results  You will want to keep these steps as short as possible; one to two operations should be enough much of the time. Browser automation has the reputation of being “flaky”, but in reality that is because users frequently demand too much of it. In later chapters, we will return to techniques you can use to mitigate apparent intermittent problems in tests, in particular on how to overcome race conditions between the browser and WebDriver.\nBy keeping your tests short and using the web browser only when you have absolutely no alternative, you can have many tests with minimal flake.\nA distinct advantage of Selenium tests are their inherent ability to test all components of the application, from backend to frontend, from a user\u0026rsquo;s perspective. So in other words, whilst functional tests may be expensive to run, they also encompass large business-critical portions at one time.\nTesting requirements As mentioned before, Selenium tests can be expensive to run. To what extent depends on the browser you\u0026rsquo;re running the tests against, but historically browsers\u0026rsquo; behaviour has varied so much that it has often been a stated goal to cross-test against multiple browsers.\nSelenium allows you to run the same instructions against multiple browsers on multiple operating systems, but the enumeration of all the possible browsers, their different versions, and the many operating systems they run on will quickly become a non-trivial undertaking.\nLet’s start with an example Larry has written a web site which allows users to order their own custom unicorns.\nThe general workflow (what we\u0026rsquo;ll call the “happy path”) is something like this:\n Create an account Configure their unicorn Add her to the shopping cart Check out and pay Give feedback about their unicorn  It would be tempting to write one grand Selenium script to perform all these operations–many will try. Resist the temptation! Doing so will result in a test that a) takes a long time, b) will be subject to some common issues around page rendering timing issues, and c) is such that if it fails, it won\u0026rsquo;t give you a concise, “glanceable” method for diagnosing what went wrong.\nThe preferred strategy for testing this scenario would be to break it down to a series of independent, speedy tests, each of which has one “reason” to exist.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s pretend you want to test the second step: Configuring your unicorn. It will perform the following actions:\n Create an account Configure a unicorn  Note that we\u0026rsquo;re skipping the rest of these steps, we will test the rest of the workflow in other small, discrete test cases, after we\u0026rsquo;re done with this one.\nTo start off, you need to create an account. Here you have some choices to make:\n Do you want to use an existing account? Do you want to create a new account? Are there any special properties of such a user that need to be taken into account before configuration begins?  Regardless of how you answer this question, the solution is to make it part of the \u0026ldquo;set up the data\u0026rdquo; portion of the test– if Larry has exposed an API which enables you (or anyone) to create and update user accounts, be sure to use that to answer this question– if possible, you want to launch the browser only after you have a user \u0026ldquo;in hand\u0026rdquo;, whose credentials you can just log in with.\nIf each test for each workflow begins with the creation of a user account, many seconds will be added to the execution of each test. Calling an API and talking to a database are quick, “headless” operations that don\u0026rsquo;t require the expensive process of opening a browser, navigating to the right pages, clicking and waiting for the forms to be submitted, etc.\nIdeally, you can address this set-up phase in one line of code, which will execute before any browser is launched:\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript // Create a user who has read-only permissions--they can configure a unicorn, // but they do not have payment information set up, nor do they have // administrative privileges. At the time the user is created, its email // address and password are randomly generated--you don\u0026#39;t even need to // know them. User user = UserFactory.createCommonUser(); //This method is defined elsewhere.  // Log in as this user. // Logging in on this site takes you to your personal \u0026#34;My Account\u0026#34; page, so the // AccountPage object is returned by the loginAs method, allowing you to then // perform actions from the AccountPage. AccountPage accountPage = loginAs(user.getEmail(), user.getPassword());   # Create a user who has read-only permissions--they can configure a unicorn, # but they do not have payment information set up, nor do they have # administrative privileges. At the time the user is created, its email # address and password are randomly generated--you don\u0026#39;t even need to # know them. user = user_factory.create_common_user() #This method is defined elsewhere. # Log in as this user. # Logging in on this site takes you to your personal \u0026#34;My Account\u0026#34; page, so the # AccountPage object is returned by the loginAs method, allowing you to then # perform actions from the AccountPage. account_page = login_as(user.get_email(), user.get_password())   // We don\u0026#39;t have a C# code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    # We don\u0026#39;t have a Ruby code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    // We don\u0026#39;t have a JavaScript code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR      As you can imagine, the UserFactory can be extended to provide methods such as createAdminUser(), and createUserWithPayment(). The point is, these two lines of code do not distract you from the ultimate purpose of this test: configuring a unicorn.\nThe intricacies of the Page Object model will be discussed in later chapters, but we will introduce the concept here:\nYour tests should be composed of actions, performed from the user\u0026rsquo;s point of view, within the context of pages in the site. These pages are stored as objects, which will contain specific information about how the web page is composed and how actions are performed– very little of which should concern you as a tester.\nWhat kind of unicorn do you want? You might want pink, but not necessarily. Purple has been quite popular lately. Does she need sunglasses? Star tattoos? These choices, while difficult, are your primary concern as a tester– you need to ensure that your order fulfillment center sends out the right unicorn to the right person, and that starts with these choices.\nNotice that nowhere in that paragraph do we talk about buttons, fields, drop-downs, radio buttons, or web forms. Neither should your tests! You want to write your code like the user trying to solve their problem. Here is one way of doing this (continuing from the previous example):\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript // The Unicorn is a top-level Object--it has attributes, which are set here. // This only stores the values; it does not fill out any web forms or interact // with the browser in any way. Unicorn sparkles = new Unicorn(\u0026#34;Sparkles\u0026#34;, UnicornColors.PURPLE, UnicornAccessories.SUNGLASSES, UnicornAdornments.STAR_TATTOOS); // Since we\u0026#39;re already \u0026#34;on\u0026#34; the account page, we have to use it to get to the // actual place where you configure unicorns. Calling the \u0026#34;Add Unicorn\u0026#34; method // takes us there. AddUnicornPage addUnicornPage = accountPage.addUnicorn(); // Now that we\u0026#39;re on the AddUnicornPage, we will pass the \u0026#34;sparkles\u0026#34; object to // its createUnicorn() method. This method will take Sparkles\u0026#39; attributes, // fill out the form, and click submit. UnicornConfirmationPage unicornConfirmationPage = addUnicornPage.createUnicorn(sparkles);   # The Unicorn is a top-level Object--it has attributes, which are set here. # This only stores the values; it does not fill out any web forms or interact # with the browser in any way. sparkles = Unicorn(\u0026#34;Sparkles\u0026#34;, UnicornColors.PURPLE, UnicornAccessories.SUNGLASSES, UnicornAdornments.STAR_TATTOOS) # Since we\u0026#39;re already \u0026#34;on\u0026#34; the account page, we have to use it to get to the # actual place where you configure unicorns. Calling the \u0026#34;Add Unicorn\u0026#34; method # takes us there. add_unicorn_page = account_page.add_unicorn() # Now that we\u0026#39;re on the AddUnicornPage, we will pass the \u0026#34;sparkles\u0026#34; object to # its createUnicorn() method. This method will take Sparkles\u0026#39; attributes, # fill out the form, and click submit. unicorn_confirmation_page = add_unicorn_page.create_unicorn(sparkles)   // We don\u0026#39;t have a C# code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    # We don\u0026#39;t have a Ruby code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    // We don\u0026#39;t have a JavaScript code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR      Now that you\u0026rsquo;ve configured your unicorn, you need to move on to step 3: making sure it actually worked.\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript // The exists() method from UnicornConfirmationPage will take the Sparkles // object--a specification of the attributes you want to see, and compare // them with the fields on the page. Assert.assertTrue(\u0026#34;Sparkles should have been created, with all attributes intact\u0026#34;, unicornConfirmationPage.exists(sparkles));   # The exists() method from UnicornConfirmationPage will take the Sparkles # object--a specification of the attributes you want to see, and compare # them with the fields on the page. assert unicorn_confirmation_page.exists(sparkles), \u0026#34;Sparkles should have been created, with all attributes intact\u0026#34;   // We don\u0026#39;t have a C# code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    # We don\u0026#39;t have a Ruby code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    // We don\u0026#39;t have a JavaScript code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR      Note that the tester still hasn\u0026rsquo;t done anything but talk about unicorns in this code– no buttons, no locators, no browser controls. This method of modelling the application allows you to keep these test-level commands in place and unchanging, even if Larry decides next week that he no longer likes Ruby-on-Rails and decides to re-implement the entire site in the latest Haskell bindings with a Fortran front-end.\nYour page objects will require some small maintenance in order to conform to the site redesign, but these tests will remain the same. Taking this basic design, you will want to keep going through your workflows with the fewest browser-facing steps possible. Your next workflow will involve adding a unicorn to the shopping cart. You will probably want many iterations of this test in order to make sure the cart is keeping its state properly: Is there more than one unicorn in the cart before you start? How many can fit in the shopping cart? If you create more than one with the same name and/or features, will it break? Will it only keep the existing one or will it add another?\nEach time you move through the workflow, you want to try to avoid having to create an account, login as the user, and configure the unicorn. Ideally, you\u0026rsquo;ll be able to create an account and pre-configure a unicorn via the API or database. Then all you have to do is log in as the user, locate Sparkles, and add her to the cart.\n"

Below is an example of instantiating a remote WebDriver object pointing to our remote web server, www.example.com, running our tests on Firefox.\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript FirefoxOptions firefoxOptions = new FirefoxOptions(); WebDriver driver = new RemoteWebDriver(new URL(\u0026#34;http://www.example.com\u0026#34;), firefoxOptions); driver.get(\u0026#34;http://www.google.com\u0026#34;); driver.quit();   # We don\u0026#39;t have a Python code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    // We don\u0026#39;t have a C# code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    require \u0026#39;selenium-webdriver\u0026#39; driver = Selenium::WebDriver.for :remote, url: \u0026#34;http://www.example.com\u0026#34;, desired_capabilities: :firefox driver.get \u0026#34;http://www.google.com\u0026#34; driver.close   // We don\u0026#39;t have a JavaScript code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR      To further customize our test configuration, we can add other desired capabilities.\nDesired capabilities Desired capabilities can be expanded further. All remote Webdriver capabilities are sent through JsonWireProtocol. For a list of configurable capabilities, and more information on JsonWireProtocol, please visit the documentation here.\nFor example, suppose you wanted to run Chrome on Windows XP, using Chrome version 67:\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript ChromeOptions chromeOptions = new ChromeOptions(); chromeOptions.setCapability(\u0026#34;browserVersion\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;67\u0026#34;); chromeOptions.setCapability(\u0026#34;platformName\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Windows XP\u0026#34;); WebDriver driver = new RemoteWebDriver(new URL(\u0026#34;http://www.example.com\u0026#34;), chromeOptions); driver.get(\u0026#34;http://www.google.com\u0026#34;); driver.quit();   # We don\u0026#39;t have a Python code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    // We don\u0026#39;t have a C# code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    caps = Selenium::WebDriver::Remote::Capabilities.chrome caps.platform = Windows XP caps.version = 67 driver = Selenium::WebDriver.for :remote, :url =\u0026gt; \u0026#34;http://www.example.com\u0026#34;, :desired_capabilities =\u0026gt; caps   // We don\u0026#39;t have a JavaScript code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR      Local file detector The Local File Detector allows the transfer of files from the client machine to the remote server. For example, if a test needs to upload a file to a web application, a remote WebDriver can automatically transfer the file from the local machine to the remote web server during runtime. This allows the file to be uploaded from the remote machine running the test. It is not enabled by default and can be enabled in the following way:\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript driver.setFileDetector(new LocalFileDetector());   # We don\u0026#39;t have a Python code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    // We don\u0026#39;t have a C# code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    @driver.file_detector = lambda do |args| # args =\u0026gt; [\u0026#34;/path/to/file\u0026#34;] str = args.first.to_s str if File.exist?(str) end   // We don\u0026#39;t have a JavaScript code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR      Once the above code is defined, you can upload a file in your test in the following way:\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript driver.get(\u0026#34;http://sso.dev.saucelabs.com/test/guinea-file-upload\u0026#34;); WebElement upload = driver.findElement(By.id(\u0026#34;myfile\u0026#34;)); upload.sendKeys(\u0026#34;/Users/sso/the/local/path/to/darkbulb.jpg\u0026#34;);   # We don\u0026#39;t have a Python code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    // We don\u0026#39;t have a C# code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    @driver.navigate.to \u0026#34;http://sso.dev.saucelabs.com/test/guinea-file-upload\u0026#34; element = @driver.find_element(:id, \u0026#39;myfile\u0026#39;) element.send_keys \u0026#34;/Users/sso/SauceLabs/sauce/hostess/maitred/maitred/public/images/darkbulb.jpg\u0026#34;   // We don\u0026#39;t have a JavaScript code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR      "

	"content": " Capitalisation of titles One should avoid title capitalisation, such as A Very Fine Heading, and instead go for A very fine heading. Gratutious capitalisation, or title case, often show a misunderstanding of – or a disregard for – orthographic conventions. We prefer what is known as sentence case, with a single initial capital to start headers.\nLine length When editing the documentation’s source, which is written in plain HTML, limit your line lengths to around 72 characters.\nSome of us take this one step further and use what is called semantic linefeeds, which is a technique whereby the HTML source lines, which are not read by the public, are split at ‘natural breaks’ in the prose. In other words, sentences are split at natural breaks between clauses. Instead of fussing with the lines of each paragraph so that they all end near the right margin, linefeeds can be added anywhere that there is a break between ideas.\nThis can make diffs very easy to read when collaborating through git, but it is not something we enforce contributors to use.\n"

If your site opens a new tab or window, Selenium will let you work with it using a window handle. Each window has a unique identifier which remains persistent in a single session. You can get the window handle of the current window by using:\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript driver.getWindowHandle();  driver.current_window_handle  driver.CurrentWindowHandle;   driver.window_handle  await driver.getWindowHandle();     Switching windows or tabs Clicking a link which opens in a new window will focus the new window or tab on screen, but WebDriver will not know which window the Operating System considers active. To work with the new window you will need to switch to it. If you have only two tabs or windows open, and you know which window you start with, by the process of elimination you can loop over both windows or tabs that WebDriver can see, and switch to the one which is not the original.\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript //Store the ID of the original window String originalWindow = driver.getWindowHandle(); //Check we don\u0026#39;t have other windows open already assert driver.getWindowHandles().size() == 1; //Click the link which opens in a new window driver.findElement(By.linkText(\u0026#34;new window\u0026#34;)).click(); //Wait for the new window or tab wait.until(numberOfWindowsToBe(2)); //Loop through until we find a new window handle for (String windowHandle : driver.getWindowHandles()) { if(!originalWindow.contentEquals(windowHandle)) { driver.switchTo().window(windowHandle); break; } } //Wait for the new tab to finish loading content wait.until(titleIs(\u0026#34;Selenium documentation\u0026#34;));   from selenium import webdriver from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait from selenium.webdriver.support import expected_conditions as EC # Start the driver with webdriver.Firefox() as driver: # Open URL driver.get(\u0026#34;https://seleniumhq.github.io/docs/wd.html\u0026#34;) # Setup wait for later wait = WebDriverWait(driver, 10) # Store the ID of the original window original_window = driver.current_window_handle # Check we don\u0026#39;t have other windows open already assert len(driver.window_handles) == 1 # Click the link which opens in a new window driver.find_element_by_link_text(\u0026#34;new window\u0026#34;).click() # Wait for the new window or tab wait.until(EC.number_of_windows_to_be(2)) # Loop through until we find a new window handle for window_handle in driver.window_handles: if window_handle != original_window: driver.switch_to.window(window_handle) break # Wait for the new tab to finish loading content wait.until(EC.title_is(\u0026#34;Selenium documentation\u0026#34;))   //Store the ID of the original window string originalWindow = driver.CurrentWindowHandle; //Check we don\u0026#39;t have other windows open already Assert.AreEqual(driver.WindowHandles.Count, 1); //Click the link which opens in a new window driver.FindElement(By.LinkText(\u0026#34;new window\u0026#34;)).Click(); //Wait for the new window or tab wait.Until(wd =\u0026gt; wd.WindowHandles.Count == 2); //Loop through until we find a new window handle foreach(string window in driver.WindowHandles) { if(originalWindow != window) { driver.SwitchTo().Window(window); break; } } //Wait for the new tab to finish loading content wait.Until(wd =\u0026gt; wd.Title == \u0026#34;Selenium documentation\u0026#34;);   #Store the ID of the original window original_window = driver.window_handle #Check we don\u0026#39;t have other windows open already assert(driver.window_handles.length == 1, \u0026#39;Expected one window\u0026#39;) #Click the link which opens in a new window driver.find_element(link: \u0026#39;new window\u0026#39;).click #Wait for the new window or tab wait.until { driver.window_handles.length == 2 } #Loop through until we find a new window handle driver.window_handles.each do |handle| if handle != original_window driver.switch_to.window handle break end end #Wait for the new tab to finish loading content wait.until { driver.title == \u0026#39;Selenium documentation\u0026#39;}   //Store the ID of the original window const originalWindow = await driver.getWindowHandle(); //Check we don\u0026#39;t have other windows open already assert((await driver.getAllWindowHandles()).length === 1); //Click the link which opens in a new window await driver.findElement(By.linkText(\u0026#39;new window\u0026#39;)).click(); //Wait for the new window or tab await driver.wait( async () =\u0026gt; (await driver.getAllWindowHandles()).length === 2, 10000 ); //Loop through until we find a new window handle const windows = await driver.getAllWindowHandles(); windows.forEach(async handle =\u0026gt; { if (handle !== originalWindow) { await driver.switchTo().window(handle); } }); //Wait for the new tab to finish loading content await driver.wait(until.titleIs(\u0026#39;Selenium documentation\u0026#39;), 10000);     Closing a window or tab When you are finished with a window or tab and it is not the last window or tab open in your browser, you should close it and switch back to the window you were using previously. Assuming you followed the code sample in the previous section you will have the previous window handle stored in a variable. Put this together and you will get:\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript //Close the tab or window driver.close(); //Switch back to the old tab or window driver.switchTo().window(originalWindow);   #Close the tab or window driver.close() #Switch back to the old tab or window driver.switch_to.window(original_window)   //Close the tab or window driver.Close(); //Switch back to the old tab or window driver.SwitchTo().Window(originalWindow);   #Close the tab or window driver.close #Switch back to the old tab or window driver.switch_to.window original_window   //Close the tab or window await driver.close(); //Switch back to the old tab or window await driver.switchTo().window(originalWindow);     Forgetting to switch back to another window handle after closing a window will leave WebDriver executing on the now closed page, and will trigger a No Such Window Exception. You must switch back to a valid window handle in order to continue execution.\nQuitting the browser at the end of a session When you are finished with the browser session you should call quit, instead of close:\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript driver.quit();  driver.quit()  driver.Quit();   driver.quit  await driver.quit();      Quit will:  Close all the windows and tabs associated with that WebDriver session The browser process The background driver process Notify Selenium Grid that the browser is no longer in use so it can be used by another session (if you are using Selenium Grid)   Failure to call quit will leave extra background processes and ports running on your machine which could cause you problems later.\nSome test frameworks offer methods and annotations which you can hook into to tear down at the end of a test.\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript /** * Example using JUnit * https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/api/org/junit/jupiter/api/AfterAll.html */ @AfterAll public static void tearDown() { driver.quit(); }   # We don\u0026#39;t have a Python code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    /* Example using Visual Studio\u0026#39;s UnitTesting https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.visualstudio.testtools.unittesting.aspx */ [TestCleanup] public void TearDown() { driver.Quit(); }   # We don\u0026#39;t have a Ruby code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    /** * Example using Mocha * https://mochajs.org/#hooks */ after(\u0026#39;Tear down\u0026#39;, async function () { await driver.quit(); });     If not running WebDriver in a test context, you may consider using try / finally which is offered by most languages so that an exception will still clean up the WebDriver session.\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript try { //WebDriver code here... } finally { driver.quit(); }   try: #WebDriver code here... finally: driver.quit()   try { #WebDriver code here... } finally { driver.Quit(); }   begin #WebDriver code here... ensure driver.quit end   try { //WebDriver code here... } finally { await driver.quit(); }     Python\u0026rsquo;s WebDriver now supports the python context manager, which when using the with keyword can automatically quit the driver at the end of execution.\nwith webdriver.Firefox() as driver: # WebDriver code here... # WebDriver will automatically quit after indentation Frames and Iframes Frames are a now deprecated means of building a site layout from multiple documents on the same domain. You are unlikely to work with them unless you are working with an pre HTML5 webapp. Iframes allow the insertion of a document from an entirely different domain, and are still commonly used.\nIf you need to work with frames or iframes, Webdriver allows you to work with them in the same way. Consider a button within an iframe. If we inspect the element using the browser development tools, we might see the following:\n\u0026lt;div id=\u0026#34;modal\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;iframe id=\u0026#34;buttonframe\u0026#34; name=\u0026#34;myframe\u0026#34; src=\u0026#34;https://seleniumhq.github.io/docs/iframe.html\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;button\u0026gt;Click here\u0026lt;/button\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/iframe\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; If it wasn\u0026rsquo;t for the iframe we would expect to click on the button using something like:\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript //This won\u0026#39;t work driver.findElement(By.tagName(\u0026#34;button\u0026#34;)).click();   # We don\u0026#39;t have a Python code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    //This won\u0026#39;t work driver.FindElement(By.TagName(\u0026#34;button\u0026#34;)).Click();   # We don\u0026#39;t have a Ruby code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    // This won\u0026#39;t work await driver.findElement(By.css(\u0026#39;button\u0026#39;)).click();     However, if there are no buttons outside of the iframe, you might instead get a no such element error. This happens because Selenium is only aware of the elements in the top level document. To interact with the button, we will need to first switch to the frame, in a similar way to how we switch windows. WebDriver offers three ways of switching to a frame.\nUsing a WebElement Switching using a WebElement is the most flexible option. You can find the frame using your preferred selector and switch to it.\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript //Store the web element WebElement iframe = driver.findElement(By.cssSelector(\u0026#34;#modal\u0026gt;iframe\u0026#34;)); //Switch to the frame driver.switchTo().frame(iframe); //Now we can click the button driver.findElement(By.tagName(\u0026#34;button\u0026#34;)).click();   # We don\u0026#39;t have a Python code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    //Store the web element IWebElement iframe = driver.FindElement(By.CssSelector(\u0026#34;#modal\u0026gt;iframe\u0026#34;)); //Switch to the frame driver.SwitchTo().Frame(iframe); //Now we can click the button driver.FindElement(By.TagName(\u0026#34;button\u0026#34;)).Click();   # We don\u0026#39;t have a Ruby code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    // Store the web element const iframe = await driver.findElement(By.css(\u0026#39;#modal \u0026gt; iframe\u0026#39;)); // Switch to the frame await driver.switchTo().frame(iframe); // Now we can click the button await driver.findElement(By.css(\u0026#39;button\u0026#39;)).click();     Using a name or ID If your frame or iframe has an id or name attribute, this can be used instead. If the name or ID is not unique on the page, then the first one found will be switched to.\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript //Using the ID driver.switchTo().frame(\u0026#34;buttonframe\u0026#34;); //Or using the name instead driver.switchTo().frame(\u0026#34;myframe\u0026#34;); //Now we can click the button driver.findElement(By.tagName(\u0026#34;button\u0026#34;)).click();   # We don\u0026#39;t have a Python code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    //Using the ID driver.SwitchTo().Frame(\u0026#34;buttonframe\u0026#34;); //Or using the name instead driver.SwitchTo().Frame(\u0026#34;myframe\u0026#34;); //Now we can click the button driver.FindElement(By.TagName(\u0026#34;button\u0026#34;)).Click();   # We don\u0026#39;t have a Ruby code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    // Using the ID await driver.switchTo().frame(\u0026#39;buttonframe\u0026#39;); // Or using the name instead await driver.switchTo().frame(\u0026#39;myframe\u0026#39;); // Now we can click the button await driver.findElement(By.css(\u0026#39;button\u0026#39;)).click();     Using an index It is also possible to use the index of the frame, such as can be queried using window.frames in JavaScript.\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript // Switches to the second frame driver.switchTo().frame(1);   # We don\u0026#39;t have a Ruby code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    // Switches to the second frame driver.SwitchTo().Frame(1);   # We don\u0026#39;t have a Python code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    // Switches to the second frame await driver.switchTo().frame(1);     Leaving a frame To leave an iframe or frameset, switch back to the default content like so:\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript // Return to the top level driver.switchTo().defaultContent();   # We don\u0026#39;t have a Python code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    // Return to the top level driver.SwitchTo().DefaultContent();   # We don\u0026#39;t have a Ruby code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    // Return to the top level await driver.switchTo().defaultContent();     Window management Screen resolution can impact how your web application renders, so WebDriver provides mechanisms for moving and resizing the browser window.\nGet window size Fetches the size of the browser window in pixels.\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript //Access each dimension individually int width = driver.manage().window().getSize().getWidth(); int height = driver.manage().window().getSize().getHeight(); //Or store the dimensions and query them later Dimension size = driver.manage().window().getSize(); int width1 = size.getWidth(); int height1 = size.getHeight();   //Access each dimension individually width = driver.get_window_size().get(\u0026#34;width\u0026#34;) height = driver.get_window_size().get(\u0026#34;height\u0026#34;) //Or store the dimensions and query them later size = driver.get_window_size() width1 = size.get(\u0026#34;width\u0026#34;) height1 = size.get(\u0026#34;height\u0026#34;)   //Access each dimension individually int width = driver.Manage().Window.Size.Width; int height = driver.Manage().Window.Size.Height; //Or store the dimensions and query them later System.Drawing.Size size = driver.Manage().Window.Size; int width1 = size.Width; int height1 = size.Height;   # We don\u0026#39;t have a Ruby code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    // Access each dimension individually const { width, height } = await driver.manage().window().getRect(); // Or store the dimensions and query them later const rect = await driver.manage().window().getRect(); const width1 = rect.width; const height1 = rect.height;     Set window size Restores the window and sets the window size.

This meant that all browser traffic passed through Selenium could be captured or manipulated. The captureNetworkTraffic() method purported to capture all of the network traffic between the browser and the site being automated, including HTTP response codes.\nSelenium WebDriver is a completely different approach to browser automation, preferring to act more like a user and this is represented in the way you write tests with WebDriver. In automated functional testing, checking the status code is not a particularly important detail of a test\u0026rsquo;s failure; the steps that preceded it are more important.\nThe browser will always represent the HTTP status code, imagine for example a 404 or a 500 error page. A simple way to “fail fast” when you encounter one of these error pages is to check the page title or content of a reliable point (e.g. the \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt; tag) after every page load. If you are using the page object model, you can include this check in your class constructor or similar point where the page load is expected. Occasionally, the HTTP code may even be represented in the browser\u0026rsquo;s error page and you could use WebDriver to read this and improve your debugging output.\nChecking the webpage itself is in line with WebDriver\u0026rsquo;s ideal practice of representing and asserting upon the user’s view of the website.\nIf you insist, an advanced solution to capturing HTTP status codes is to replicate the behaviour of Selenium RC by using a proxy. WebDriver API provides the ability to set a proxy for the browser, and there are a number of proxies that will programmatically allow you to manipulate the contents of requests sent to and received from the web server. Using a proxy lets you decide how you want to respond to redirection response codes. Additionally, not every browser makes the response codes available to WebDriver, so opting to use a proxy allows you to have a solution that works for every browser.\n"

	"title": "Locating elements",
	"tags": [],
	"description": "",
	"content": " Locating one element One of the most fundamental techniques to learn when using WebDriver is how to find elements on the page. WebDriver offers a number of built-in selector types, amongst them finding an element by its ID attribute:\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript WebElement cheese = driver.findElement(By.id(\u0026#34;cheese\u0026#34;));   driver.find_element_by_id(\u0026#34;cheese\u0026#34;)   IWebElement element = driver.FindElement(By.Id(\u0026#34;cheese\u0026#34;));   driver.find_element(id: \u0026#34;cheese\u0026#34;)   const cheese = await driver.findElement(By.id(\u0026#39;cheese\u0026#39;));     As seen in the example, locating elements in WebDriver is done on the WebDriver instance object. The findElement(By) method returns another fundamental object type, the WebElement.\n WebDriver represents the browser WebElement represents a particular DOM node (a control, e.g. a link or input field, etc.)  Once you have a reference to a web element that\u0026rsquo;s been “found”, you can narrow the scope of your search by using the same call on that object instance:\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript WebElement cheese = driver.findElement(By.id(\u0026#34;cheese\u0026#34;)); WebElement cheddar = cheese.findElement(By.id(\u0026#34;cheddar\u0026#34;));   cheese = driver.find_element_by_id(\u0026#34;cheese\u0026#34;) cheddar = cheese.find_elements_by_id(\u0026#34;cheddar\u0026#34;)   IWebElement cheese = driver.FindElement(By.Id(\u0026#34;cheese\u0026#34;)); IWebElement cheddar = cheese.FindElement(By.Id(\u0026#34;cheddar\u0026#34;));   cheese = driver.find_element(id: \u0026#34;cheese\u0026#34;) cheddar = cheese.find_elements(id: \u0026#34;cheddar\u0026#34;)   const cheese = await driver.findElement(By.id(\u0026#39;cheese\u0026#39;)); const cheddar = await cheese.findElement(By.id(\u0026#39;cheddar\u0026#39;));     You can do this because both the WebDriver and WebElement types implement the SearchContext interface. In WebDriver, this is known as a role-based interface. Role-based interfaces allow you to determine whether a particular driver implementation supports a given feature. These interfaces are clearly defined and try to adhere to having only a single role of responsibility. You can read more about WebDriver\u0026rsquo;s design and what roles are supported in which drivers in the Some Other Section Which Must Be Named. Consequently, the By interface used above also supports a number of additional locator strategies. A nested lookup might not be the most effective cheese location strategy since it requires two separate commands to be issued to the browser; first searching the DOM for an element with ID “cheese”, then a search for “cheddar” in a narrowed context.\nTo improve the performance slightly, we should try to use a more specific locator: WebDriver supports looking up elements by CSS locators, allowing us to combine the two previous locators into one search:\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript driver.findElement(By.cssSelector(\u0026#34;#cheese #cheddar\u0026#34;));   cheddar = driver.find_element_by_css_selector(\u0026#34;#cheese #cheddar\u0026#34;)   driver.FindElement(By.CssSelector(\u0026#34;#cheese #cheddar\u0026#34;));   mucho_cheese = driver.find_elements(css: \u0026#34;#cheese #cheddar\u0026#34;)   const cheddar = await driver.findElement(By.css(\u0026#39;#cheese #cheddar\u0026#39;));     Locating multiple elements It\u0026rsquo;s possible that the document we are working with may turn out to have an ordered list of the cheese we like the best:\n\u0026lt;ol id=cheese\u0026gt; \u0026lt;li id=cheddar\u0026gt;… \u0026lt;li id=brie\u0026gt;… \u0026lt;li id=rochefort\u0026gt;… \u0026lt;li id=camembert\u0026gt;… \u0026lt;/ul\u0026gt; Since more cheese is undisputably better, and it would be cumbersome to have to retrieve each of the items individually, a superior technique for retrieving cheese is to make use of the pluralized version findElements(By). This method returns a collection of web elements. If only one element is found, it will still return a collection (of one element). If no elements match the locator, an empty list will be returned.\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript List\u0026lt;WebElement\u0026gt; muchoCheese = driver.findElements(By.cssSelector(\u0026#34;#cheese li\u0026#34;));   mucho_cheese = driver.find_elements_by_css_selector(\u0026#34;#cheese li\u0026#34;)   IReadOnlyList\u0026lt;IWebElement\u0026gt; muchoCheese = driver.FindElements(By.CssSelector(“#cheese li”));   mucho_cheese = driver.find_elements(css: \u0026#34;#cheese li\u0026#34;)   const muchoCheese = await driver.findElements(By.css(\u0026#39;#cheese li\u0026#39;));     Element selection strategies There are eight different built-in element location strategies in WebDriver:\n   Locator Description     class name Locates elements whose class name contains the search value (compound class names are not permitted)   css selector Locates elements matching a CSS selector   id Locates elements whose ID attribute matches the search value   name Locates elements whose NAME attribute matches the search value   link text Locates anchor elements whose visible text matches the search value   partial link text Locates anchor elements whose visible text matches the search value   tag name Locates elements whose tag name matches the search value   xpath Locates elements matching an XPath expression    Tips on using selectors In general, if HTML IDs are available, unique, and consistently predictable, they are the preferred method for locating an element on a page. They tend to work very quickly, and forego much processing that comes with complicated DOM traversals.\nIf unique IDs are unavailable, a well-written CSS selector is the preferred method of locating an element. XPath works as well as CSS selectors, but the syntax is complicated and frequently difficult to debug. Though XPath selectors are very flexible, they\u0026rsquo;re typically not performance tested by browser vendors and tend to be quite slow.\nSelection strategies based on link text and partial link text have drawbacks in that they only work on link elements. Additionally, they call down to XPath selectors internally in WebDriver.\nTag name can be a dangerous way to locate elements. There are frequently multiple elements of the same tag present on the page. This is mostly useful when calling the findElements(By) method which returns a collection of elements.\nThe recommendation is to keep your locators as compact and readable as possible. Asking WebDriver to traverse the DOM structure is an expensive operation, and the more you can narrow the scope of your search, the better.\n"

	"content": " To use Selenium Grid, you need to maintain your own infrastructure for the nodes. As this can be a cumbersome and time intense effort, many organizations use IaaS providers such as Amazon EC2 and Google Compute to provide this infrastructure.\nOther options include using providers such as Sauce Labs or Testing Bot who provide a Selenium Grid as a service in the cloud. It is certainly possible to also run nodes on your own hardware. This chapter will go into detail about the option of running your own grid, complete with its own node infrastructure.\nQuick start This example will show you how to start the Selenium 2 Grid Hub, and register both a WebDriver node and a Selenium 1 RC legacy node. We’ll also show you how to call the grid from Java. The hub and nodes are shown here running on the same machine, but of course you can copy the selenium-server-standalone to multiple machines.\nThe selenium-server-standalone package includes the hub, WebDriver, and legacy RC needed to run the Grid, ant is not required anymore. You can download the selenium-server-standalone-.jar from http://www.seleniumhq.org/download/.\nStep 1: Start the Hub The Hub is the central point that will receive test requests and distribute them to the right nodes. The distribution is done on a capabilities basis, meaning a test requiring a set of capabilities will only be distributed to nodes offering that set or subset of capabilities.\nBecause a test\u0026rsquo;s desired capabilities are just what the name implies, desired, the hub cannot guarantee that it will locate a node fully matching the requested desired capabilities set.\nOpen a command prompt and navigate to the directory where you copied the selenium-server-standalone.jar file. You start the hub by passing the -role hub flag to the standalone server:\njava -jar selenium-server-standalone.jar -role hub The Hub will listen to port 4444 by default. You can view the status of the hub by opening a browser window and navigating to http://localhost:4444/grid/console.\nTo change the default port, you can add the optional -port flag with an integer representing the port to listen to when you run the command. Also, all of the other options you see in the JSON config file (seen below) are possible command-line flags.\nYou certainly can get by with only the simple command shown above, but if you need more advanced configuration, then you may also for convenience specify a JSON format config file to configure the hub when you start it. You can do it like so:\njava -jar selenium-server-standalone.jar -role hub -hubConfig hubConfig.json -debug Below you will see an example of a hubConfig.json file. We will go into more detail on how to provide node configuration files in step 2.\n{ \u0026#34;_comment\u0026#34; : \u0026#34;Configuration for Hub - hubConfig.json\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;host\u0026#34;: ip, \u0026#34;maxSession\u0026#34;: 5, \u0026#34;port\u0026#34;: 4444, \u0026#34;cleanupCycle\u0026#34;: 5000, \u0026#34;timeout\u0026#34;: 300000, \u0026#34;newSessionWaitTimeout\u0026#34;: -1, \u0026#34;servlets\u0026#34;: [], \u0026#34;prioritizer\u0026#34;: null, \u0026#34;capabilityMatcher\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;org.openqa.grid.internal.utils.DefaultCapabilityMatcher\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;throwOnCapabilityNotPresent\u0026#34;: true, \u0026#34;nodePolling\u0026#34;: 180000, \u0026#34;platform\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;WINDOWS\u0026#34;} Step 2: Start the Nodes Regardless of whether you want to run a grid with new WebDriver functionality, or a grid with Selenium 1 RC functionality, or both at the same time, you use the same selenium-server-standalone.jar file to start the nodes:\njava -jar selenium-server-standalone.jar -role node -hub http://localhost:4444 If a port is not specified through the -port flag, a free port will be chosen. You can run multiple nodes on one machine but if you do so, you need to be aware of your systems memory resources and problems with screenshots if your tests take them.\nConfiguration of Node with options As mentioned, for backwards compatibility “wd” and “rc” roles are still a valid subset of the “node” role. But those roles limit the types of remote connections to their corresponding API, while “node” allows both RC and WebDriver remote connections.\nPassing JVM properties (using the -D flag before the -jar argument) on the command line as well, and these will be picked up and propagated to the nodes:\n-Dwebdriver.chrome.driver=chromedriver.exe\nConfiguration of Node with JSON You can also start grid nodes that are configured with a JSON configuration file\njava -Dwebdriver.chrome.driver=chromedriver.exe -jar selenium-server-standalone.jar -role node -nodeConfig node1Config.json And here is an example of a nodeConfig.json file:\n{ \u0026#34;capabilities\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;browserName\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;firefox\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;acceptSslCerts\u0026#34;: true, \u0026#34;javascriptEnabled\u0026#34;: true, \u0026#34;takesScreenshot\u0026#34;: false, \u0026#34;firefox_profile\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;browser-version\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;27\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;platform\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;WINDOWS\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;maxInstances\u0026#34;: 5, \u0026#34;firefox_binary\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;cleanSession\u0026#34;: true }, { \u0026#34;browserName\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;chrome\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;maxInstances\u0026#34;: 5, \u0026#34;platform\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;WINDOWS\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;webdriver.chrome.driver\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;C:/Program Files (x86)/Google/Chrome/Application/chrome.exe\u0026#34; }, { \u0026#34;browserName\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;internet explorer\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;maxInstances\u0026#34;: 1, \u0026#34;platform\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;WINDOWS\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;webdriver.ie.driver\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;C:/Program Files (x86)/Internet Explorer/iexplore.exe\u0026#34; } ], \u0026#34;configuration\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;_comment\u0026#34; : \u0026#34;Configuration for Node\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;cleanUpCycle\u0026#34;: 2000, \u0026#34;timeout\u0026#34;: 30000, \u0026#34;proxy\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;org.openqa.grid.selenium.proxy.WebDriverRemoteProxy\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;port\u0026#34;: 5555, \u0026#34;host\u0026#34;: ip, \u0026#34;register\u0026#34;: true, \u0026#34;hubPort\u0026#34;: 4444, \u0026#34;maxSession\u0026#34;: 5 } } A note about the -host flag\nFor both hub and node, if the -host flag is not specified, 0.0.0.0 will be used by default. This will bind to all the public (non-loopback) IPv4 interfaces of the machine. If you have a special network configuration or any component that creates extra network interfaces, it is advised to set the -host flag with a value that allows the hub/node to be reachable from a different machine.\nSpecifying the port The default TCP/IP port used by the hub is 4444. If you need to change the port please use above mentioned configurations\nTroubleshooting Using Log file For advance troubleshooting you can specify log file to log system messages. For that start Selenium GRID hub or node with -log argument. Please see the below example\njava -jar selenium-server-standalone.jar -role hub -log log.txt Use your favorite text editor to open log file (log.txt in above example) to find \u0026ldquo;ERROR\u0026rdquo; logs if you get issues.\nUsing -debug argument Also you can use -debug argument to print debug logs on console. For that start Selenium Grid Hub or Node with -debug argument. Please see the below example\njava -jar selenium-server-standalone.jar -role hub -debug Warning The Selenium Grid must be protected from external access using appropriate firewall permissions.\nFailure to protect your Grid could result in one or more of the following occurring: * You provide open access to your Grid infrastructure * You allow 3rd parties to access internal web applications and files * You allow 3rd parties to run custom binaries\nSee this blog post on Detectify which gives a good overview of how a publicly exposed Grid could be misused: Don\u0026rsquo;t Leave your Grid Wide Open.\nDocker Selenium Docker provides a convenient way to provision and scale Selenium Grid infrastructure in a unit known as a container. Containers are standardised units of software that contain everything required to run the desired application including all dependencies in a reliable and repeatable way on different machines.\nThe Selenium project maintains a set of Docker images which you can download and run to get a working grid up and running quickly. Nodes are available for both Firefox and Chrome. Full details of how to provision a grid can be found within the Docker Selenium repository.\nPrerequisite The only requirement to run a Grid is to have Docker installed and working. Install Docker.\n"

	"content": " Acceptance testing This type of test is done in order to determine if a product\u0026rsquo;s feature matches its requirements. This generally involves the customer\u0026rsquo;s feedback or specification.\nFor web applications, the automation of this testing can be done directly with Selenium by simulating user expected behavior. This simulation could be done by record/playback or through the different supported languages as explained in this documentation. Note: Acceptance testing is a subtype of functional testing, which some people might also refer to.\nFunctional testing This type of test is done in order to determine if a product\u0026rsquo;s feature functions properly, without issues.\nThis generally include: the tests work without errors (404, exceptions\u0026hellip;), in an usable way (right redirections),\nin an accessible way and matching its specifications\n(see acceptance testing above).\nFor web applications, the automation of this testing can be done directly with Selenium by simulating expected returns.\nThis simulation could be done by record/playback or through\nthe different supported languages as explainedin this documentation.\nPerformance testing As its name indicates, performance tests are done in order to measure how well an application is performing.\nThere are two main sub-types for performance testing:\nLoad testing Load testing is done in order to verify how well the application works under different defined loads (usually a particular number of users connected at once)\nStress testing Stress testing is done in order to verify how well the application works under stress (or above the maximum supported load).\nGenerally, performance tests are done by executing a number of Selenium written tests simulating different users hitting a particular function on the web app and retrieving some meaningful measurements.\nThis is generally done by other tools that retrieve the metrics. One such tools is JMeter.\nFor a web application, details to measure include: throughput, latency, data loss, individual component loading times\u0026hellip;\nNote: All browsers have a performance tab in their developers\u0026rsquo; tools section (accessible by pressing F12)\nNote 2: is a subtype of non-functional testing as this is generally measured per system and not per function/feature.\nRegression testing This testing is generally done after a change, fix or feature addition.\nIn order to ensure that the change has not broken any of the existing functionality, some already executed tests are executed again.\nThe set of re-executed test can be full or partial and can include several different types, depending on the application and development team.\nTest driven development (TDD) Rather than a test type per se, TDD is an iterative development methodology in which tests drive the design of a feature.\nEach cycle starts by creating a set of unit tests that the feature should pass (which should fail their first time executed).\nAfter this, development takes place in order to make the tests pass. The tests are executed again starting another cycle and this process continues until all tests are passing.\nThis aims to speed up the development of an application based on the fact that defects are less costly the earlier they are found.\nBehavior-driven development (BDD) BDD is also an iterative development methodology based on above (TDD) in which the goal is to involve all the parties in the development of an application.\nEach cycle starts by creating some specification (which should fail). Then create the failing unit tests (which should also fail) and then create the development.\nThis cycle is repeated until all type of tests are passing.\nIn order to do so, a specification language is used. It should be understandable by all parties and simple, standard and explicit. Most tools use Gherkin as this language.\nThe goal is to be able to detect even more errors than TDD by targeting potential acceptance errors too and make communication between parties smoother.\nA set of tools are currently available in order to write the specifications and match them with code functions, such as Cucumber or SpecFlow.\nA set of tools are built on top of Selenium to make this process even faster by directly transform the BDD specifications into executable code. Some of these are: JBehave, Capybara and Robot Framework.\n"

	"description": "",
	"content": " Getting started with WebDriver Selenium supports automation of all the major browsers in the market through the use of WebDriver. WebDriver is an API and protocol that defines a language-neutral interface for controlling the behaviour of web browsers. Each browser is backed by a specific WebDriver implementation, called a driver. The driver is the component responsible for delegating down to the browser, and handles communication to and from Selenium and the browser.\nThis separation is part of a conscious effort to have browser vendors take responsibility for the implementation for their browsers. Selenium makes use of these third party drivers where possible, but also provides its own drivers maintained by the project for the cases when this is not a reality.\nThe Selenium framework ties all of these pieces together through a user-facing interface that enables the different browser backends to be used transparently, enabling cross-browser and cross-platform automation.\nMore details about drivers can be found in Driver Idiosyncrasies.\n"

	"content": "For multiple reasons, logging into sites like Gmail and Facebook using WebDriver is not recommended. Aside from being against the usage terms for these sites (where you risk having the account shut down), it is slow and unreliable.\nThe ideal practice is to use the APIs that email providers offer, or in the case of Facebook the developer tools service which exposes an API for creating test accounts, friends and so forth. Although using an API might seem like a bit of extra hard work, you will be paid back in speed, reliability, and stability. The API is also unlikely to change whereas webpages and HTML locators change often and require you to update your test framework.\nLogging in to third party sites using WebDriver at any point of your test increases the risk of your test failing because it makes your test longer. A general rule of thumb is that longer tests are more fragile and unreliable.\nWebDriver implementations that are W3C conformant also annotate the navigator object with a webdriver property so that Denial of Service attacks can be mitigated.\n"

	"content": " WebDriver can generally be said to have a blocking API. Because it is an out-of-process library that instructs the browser what to do, and because the web platform has an intrinsically asynchronous nature, WebDriver doesn\u0026rsquo;t track the active, real-time state of the DOM. This comes with some challenges that we will discuss here.\nFrom experience, most intermittents that arise from use of Selenium and WebDriver are connected to race conditions that occur between the browser and the user\u0026rsquo;s instructions. An example could be that the user instructs the browser to navigate to a page, then gets a no such element error when trying to find an element.\nConsider the following document:\n\u0026lt;!doctype html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;meta charset=utf-8\u0026gt; \u0026lt;title\u0026gt;Race Condition Example\u0026lt;/title\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script\u0026gt; var initialised = false; window.addEventListener(\u0026#34;load\u0026#34;, function() { var newElement = document.createElement(\u0026#34;p\u0026#34;); newElement.textContent = \u0026#34;Hello from JavaScript!\u0026#34;; document.body.appendChild(newElement); initialised = true; }); \u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; The WebDriver instructions might look innocent enough:\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript driver.get(\u0026#34;file:///race_condition.html\u0026#34;); WebElement element = driver.findElement(By.tagName(\u0026#34;p\u0026#34;)); assertEquals(element.getText(), \u0026#34;Hello from JavaScript!\u0026#34;);   driver.navigate(\u0026#34;file:///race_condition.html\u0026#34;) el = driver.find_element_by_tag_name(\u0026#34;p\u0026#34;) assert el.text == \u0026#34;Hello from JavaScript!\u0026#34;   driver.Navigate().GoToUrl(\u0026#34;file:///race_condition.html\u0026#34;); IWebElement element = driver.FindElement(By.TagName(\u0026#34;p\u0026#34;)); assertEquals(element.Text, \u0026#34;Hello from JavaScript!\u0026#34;);   # We don\u0026#39;t have a Ruby code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    await driver.get(\u0026#39;file:///race_condition.html\u0026#39;); const element = await driver.findElement(By.css(\u0026#39;p\u0026#39;)); assert.strictEqual(await element.getText(), \u0026#39;Hello from JavaScript!\u0026#39;);     The issue here is that the default page load strategy used in WebDriver listens for the document.readyState to change to \u0026quot;complete\u0026quot; before returning from the call to navigate. Because the p element is added after the document has completed loading, this WebDriver script might be intermittent. It “might” be intermittent because no guarantees can be made about elements or events that trigger asynchronously without explicitly waiting—or blocking—on those events.\nFortunately, using the normal instruction set available on the WebElement interface—such as WebElement.click and _WebElement.sendKeys_—are guaranteed to be synchronous, in that the function calls won\u0026rsquo;t return (or the callback won\u0026rsquo;t trigger in callback-style languages) until the command has been completed in the browser. The advanced user interaction APIs, Keyboard and Mouse, are exceptions as they are explicitly intended as “do what I say” asynchronous commands.\nWaiting is having the automated task execution elapse a certain amount of time before continuing with the next step.\nTo overcome the problem of race conditions between the browser and your WebDriver script, most Selenium clients ship with a wait package. When employing a wait, you are using what is commonly referred to as an explicit wait.\nExplicit wait Explicit waits are available to Selenium clients for imperative, procedural languages. They allow your code to halt program execution, or freeze the thread, until the condition you pass it resolves. The condition is called with a certain frequency until the timeout of the wait is elapsed. This means that for as long as the condition returns a falsy value, it will keep trying and waiting.\nSince explicit waits allow you to wait for a condition to occur, they make a good fit for synchronising the state between the browser and its DOM, and your WebDriver script.\nTo remedy our buggy instruction set from earlier, we could employ a wait to have the findElement call wait until the dynamically added element from the script has been added to the DOM:\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver(); driver.get(\u0026#34;https://google.com/ncr\u0026#34;); driver.findElement(By.name(\u0026#34;q\u0026#34;)).sendKeys(\u0026#34;cheese\u0026#34; + Keys.ENTER); // Initialize and wait till element(link) became clickable - timeout in 10 seconds WebElement firstResult = new WebDriverWait(driver, 10) .until(ExpectedConditions.elementToBeClickable(By.xpath(\u0026#34;//a/h3\u0026#34;))); // Print the first result System.out.println(firstResult.getText());   from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait def document_initialised(driver): return driver.execute_script(\u0026#34;return initialised\u0026#34;) driver.navigate(\u0026#34;file:///race_condition.html\u0026#34;) WebDriverWait(driver).until(document_initialised) el = driver.find_element_by_tag_name(\u0026#34;p\u0026#34;) assert el.text == \u0026#34;Hello from JavaScript!\u0026#34;   // We don\u0026#39;t have a C# code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    # We don\u0026#39;t have a Ruby code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    const documentInitialised = () =\u0026gt; driver.executeScript(\u0026#39;return initialised\u0026#39;); await driver.get(\u0026#39;file:///race_condition.html\u0026#39;); await driver.wait(() =\u0026gt; documentInitialised(), 10000); const element = await driver.findElement(By.css(\u0026#39;p\u0026#39;)); assert.strictEqual(await element.getText(), \u0026#39;Hello from JavaScript!\u0026#39;);     We pass in the condition as a function reference that the wait will run repeatedly until its return value is truthy. A “truthful” return value is anything that evaluates to boolean true in the language at hand, such as a string, number, a boolean, an object (including a WebElement), or a populated (non-empty) sequence or list. That means an empty list evaluates to false. When the condition is truthful and the blocking wait is aborted, the return value from the condition becomes the return value of the wait.\nWith this knowledge, and because the wait utility ignores no such element errors by default, we can refactor our instructions to be more concise:\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript // We don\u0026#39;t have a Java code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait driver.navigate(\u0026#34;file:///race_condition.html\u0026#34;) el = WebDriverWait(driver).until(lambda d: return d.find_element_by_tag_name(\u0026#34;p\u0026#34;)) assert el.text == \u0026#34;Hello from JavaScript!\u0026#34;   // We don\u0026#39;t have a C# code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    # We don\u0026#39;t have a Ruby code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    // We don\u0026#39;t have a JavaScript code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR      In that example, we pass in an anonymous function (but we could also define it explicitly as we did earlier so it may be reused). The first and only argument that is passed to our condition is always a reference to our driver object, WebDriver (called d in the example). In a multi-threaded environment, you should be careful to operate on the driver reference passed in to the condition rather than the reference to the driver in the outer scope.\nBecause the wait will swallow no such element errors that are raised when the element isn\u0026rsquo;t found, the condition will retry until the element is found. Then it will take the return value, a WebElement, and pass it back through to our script.\nIf the condition fails, e.g. a truthful return value from the condition is never reached, the wait will throw/raise an error/exception called a timeout error.\nOptions The wait condition can be customised to match your needs. Sometimes it\u0026rsquo;s unnecessary to wait the full extent of the default timeout, as the penalty for not hitting a successful condition can be expensive.\nThe wait lets you pass in an argument to override the timeout:\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript //new WebDriverWait(driver,3).until(some_condition(WebElement)) new WebDriverWait(driver, 3).until(ExpectedConditions.elementToBeClickable(By.xpath(\u0026#34;//a/h3\u0026#34;)));   WebDriverWait(driver, timeout=3).until(some_condition)   // We don\u0026#39;t have a C# code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    # We don\u0026#39;t have a Ruby code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    // We don\u0026#39;t have a JavaScript code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR      Expected conditions Because it\u0026rsquo;s quite a common occurrence to have to synchronise the DOM and your instructions, most clients also come with a set of predefined expected conditions. As might be obvious by the name, they are conditions that are predefined for frequent wait operations.\nThe conditions available in the different language bindings vary, but this is a non-exhaustive list of a few:\n alert is present element exists element is visible title contains title is element staleness visible text  You can refer to the API documentation for each client binding to find an exhaustive list of expected conditions:\n Java\u0026rsquo;s org.openqa.selenium.support.ui.ExpectedConditions class Python\u0026rsquo;s selenium.webdriver.support.expected_conditions class .NET\u0026rsquo;s OpenQA.Selenium.Support.UI.ExpectedConditions type  Implicit wait There is a second type of wait that is distinct from explicit wait called implicit wait. By implicitly waiting, WebDriver polls the DOM for a certain duration when trying to find any element. This can be useful when certain elements on the webpage are not available immediately and need some time to load.\nImplicit waiting for elements to appear is disabled by default and will need to be manually enabled on a per-session basis. Mixing explicit waits and implicit waits will cause unintended consequences, namely waits sleeping for the maximum time even if the element is available or condition is true.\nWarning: Do not mix implicit and explicit waits. Doing so can cause unpredictable wait times. For example, setting an implicit wait of 10 seconds and an explicit wait of 15 seconds could cause a timeout to occur after 20 seconds.\nAn implicit wait is to tell WebDriver to poll the DOM for a certain amount of time when trying to find an element or elements if they are not immediately available. The default setting is 0, meaning disabled. Once set, the implicit wait is set for the life of the session.\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript WebDriver driver = new FirefoxDriver(); driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(10, TimeUnit.SECONDS); driver.get(\u0026#34;http://somedomain/url_that_delays_loading\u0026#34;); WebElement myDynamicElement = driver.findElement(By.id(\u0026#34;myDynamicElement\u0026#34;));   driver = Firefox() driver.implicitly_wait(10) driver.get(\u0026#34;http://somedomain/url_that_delays_loading\u0026#34;) my_dynamic_element = driver.find_element_by_id(\u0026#34;myDynamicElement\u0026#34;)   // We don\u0026#39;t have a C# code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    # We don\u0026#39;t have a Ruby code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    // We don\u0026#39;t have a JavaScript code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR      FluentWait FluentWait instance defines the maximum amount of time to wait for a condition, as well as the frequency with which to check the condition.\nUsers may configure the wait to ignore specific types of exceptions whilst waiting, such as NoSuchElementException when searching for an element on the page.\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript // Waiting 30 seconds for an element to be present on the page, checking // for its presence once every 5 seconds. Wait\u0026lt;WebDriver\u0026gt; wait = new FluentWait\u0026lt;WebDriver\u0026gt;(driver) .withTimeout(30, SECONDS) .pollingEvery(5, SECONDS) .ignoring(NoSuchElementException.class); WebElement foo = wait.until(new Function\u0026lt;WebDriver, WebElement\u0026gt;() { public WebElement apply(WebDriver driver) { return driver.findElement(By.id(\u0026#34;foo\u0026#34;)); } });   driver = Firefox() driver.get(\u0026#34;http://somedomain/url_that_delays_loading\u0026#34;) wait = WebDriverWait(driver, 10, poll_frequency=1, ignored_exceptions=[ElementNotVisibleException, ElementNotSelectableException]) element = wait.until(EC.element_to_be_clickable((By.XPATH, \u0026#34;//div\u0026#34;)))   // We don\u0026#39;t have a C# code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    # We don\u0026#39;t have a Ruby code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    // We don\u0026#39;t have a JavaScript code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR      "

	"content": " WebDriver provides an API for working with the three types of native popup message offered by JavaScript. These popups are styled by the browser and offer limited customisation.\nAlerts The simplest of these is referred to as an alert, which shows a custom message, and a single button which dismisses the alert, labelled in most browsers as OK. It can also be dismissed in most browsers by pressing the close button, but this will always do the same thing as the OK button. See an example alert.\nWebDriver can get the text from the popup and accept or dismiss these alerts.\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript //Click the link to activate the alert driver.findElement(By.linkText(\u0026#34;See an example alert\u0026#34;)).click(); //Wait for the alert to be displayed and store it in a variable Alert alert = wait.until(ExpectedConditions.alertIsPresent()); //Store the alert text in a variable String text = alert.getText(); //Press the OK button alert.accept();   # Click the link to activate the alert driver.find_element_by_link_text(\u0026#34;See an example alert\u0026#34;).click() # Wait for the alert to be displayed and store it in a variable alert = wait.until(expected_conditions.alert_is_present()) # Store the alert text in a variable text = alert.text # Press the OK button alert.accept()   //Click the link to activate the alert driver.FindElement(By.LinkText(\u0026#34;See an example alert\u0026#34;)).Click(); //Wait for the alert to be displayed and store it in a variable IAlert alert = wait.Until(ExpectedConditions.AlertIsPresent()); //Store the alert text in a variable string text = alert.Text; //Press the OK button alert.Accept();   # We don\u0026#39;t have a Ruby code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    // We don\u0026#39;t have a JavaScript code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR      Confirm A confirm box is similar to an alert, except the user can also choose to cancel the message. See a sample confirm.\nThis example also shows a different approach to storing an alert:\nJava Python C# Ruby JavaScript //Click the link to activate the alert driver.findElement(By.linkText(\u0026#34;See a sample confirm\u0026#34;)).click(); //Wait for the alert to be displayed wait.until(ExpectedConditions.alertIsPresent()); //Store the alert in a variable Alert alert = driver.switchTo().alert(); //Store the alert in a variable for reuse String text = alert.getText(); //Press the Cancel button alert.dismiss();   # Click the link to activate the alert driver.find_element_by_link_text(\u0026#34;See a sample confirm\u0026#34;).click() # Wait for the alert to be displayed wait.until(expected_conditions.alert_is_present()) # Store the alert in a variable for reuse alert = driver.switch_to.alert # Store the alert text in a variable text = alert.text # Press the Cancel button alert.dismiss()   //Click the link to activate the alert driver.FindElement(By.LinkText(\u0026#34;See a sample confirm\u0026#34;)).Click(); //Wait for the alert to be displayed wait.Until(ExpectedConditions.AlertIsPresent()); //Store the alert in a variable IAlert alert = driver.SwitchTo().Alert(); //Store the alert in a variable for reuse string text = alert.Text; //Press the Cancel button alert.Dismiss();   # We don\u0026#39;t have a Ruby code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR    // We don\u0026#39;t have a JavaScript code sample yet - Help us out and raise a PR      Prompt Prompts are similar to confirm boxes, except they also include a text input.

	"content": "Performance testing using Selenium and WebDriver is generally not advised. Not because it is incapable but because it is not optimised for the job and you are unlikely to get good results.\nIt may seem ideal to performance test in the context of the user but a suite of WebDriver tests are subjected to many points of external and internal fragility which are beyond your control; for example browser startup speed, speed of HTTP servers, response of third party servers that host JavaScript or CSS, and the instrumentation penalty of the WebDriver implementation itself. Variation at these points will cause variation in your results. It is difficult to separate the difference between the performance of your website and the performance of external resources, and it is also hard to tell what the performance penalty is for using WebDriver in the browser, especially if you are injecting scripts.\nThe other potential attraction is \u0026ldquo;saving time\u0026rdquo; — carrying out functional and performance tests at the same time. However, functional and performance tests have opposing objectives. To test functionality, a tester may need to be patient and wait for loading, but this will cloud the performance testing results and vice versa.\nTo improve the performance of your website, you will need to be able to analyse overall performance independent of environment differences, identify poor code practices, breakdown of performance of individual resources (i.e. CSS or JavaScript) in order to know what to improve. There are performance testing tools available that can do this job already, and which provide reporting and analysis which can even make improvement suggestions.\nExample (open source) packages to use are: JMeter ?\n"

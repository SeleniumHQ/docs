<h1>WebDriver</h1>

<p>The biggest change in Selenium recently
 has been the inclusion of the WebDriver API.
 Driving a browser natively as a user would either locally
 or on a remote machine using the Selenium server,
 it marks a leap forward in terms of browser automation.

<p>Selenium WebDriver fits in the same role as RC did,
 and has incorporated the original 1.x bindings.
 It refers to both the language bindings
 and the implementations of the individual browser controlling code.
 This is commonly referred to as just <em>WebDriver</em>
 or sometimes as <em>Selenium 2</em>.

<p>Selenium 1.0 + WebDriver = Selenium 2.0

<ul>
 <li>WebDriver is designed in a simpler
  and more concise programming interface
  along with addressing some limitations in the Selenium-RC API.

 <li>WebDriver is a compact object-oriented API
  when compared to Selenium 1.0.

 <li>It drives the browser much more effectively
  and overcomes the limitations of Selenium 1
  that affected our functional test coverage,
  like the file upload or download, pop-ups, and dialogs barrier.

 <li>WebDriver overcomes the limitation of Selenium RC's
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-origin_policy">single-host origin policy.</a>
</ul>

<h2>Understanding The Components</h2>


<p>Building a test suite using WebDriver will require you to understand and effectively use a number of different components. As with everything in software, different people use different terms for the same idea. Below is a breakdown of how terms are used in this description.

<h3>Terminology</h3>

<ul>
	<li><strong>API:</strong> Application Programming Interface. This is the set of "commands" you use to manipulate WebDriver.
	<li><strong>Library:</strong> A code module which contains the APIs and the code necessary to implement them. Libraries are specific to each language binding, eg .jar files for Java, .dll files for .NET, etc.
	<li><strong>Driver:</strong> Responsible for controlling the actual browser. Most drivers are created by the browser vendors themselves. Drivers are generally executable modules that run on the system with the browser itself, not on the system executing the test suite. (Although those may be the same system.) <em>NOTE: Some people refer to the drivers as proxies.</em>
	<li><strong>Framework:</strong> An additional library used as a support for WebDriver suites. These frameworks may be test frameworks such as JUnit or NUnit. They may also be frameworks supporting natural language features such as Cucumber or Robotium. Frameworks may also be written and used for things such as manipulating or configuring the system under test, data creation, test oracles, etc.
</ul>



<h3>The Parts and Pieces</h3>
<p>At its minimum, WebDriver talks to a browser through a driver. Communication is two way: WebDriver passes commands to the browser through the driver, and recieves information back via the same route.
</br>
<img src="images/basic_comms.png" width="400px" style="float:none">

<p>The driver is specific to the browser, such as ChromeDriver for Google's Chrome/Chromium, GeckoDriver for Mozilla's Firefox, etc. The driver runs on the same system as the browser. This may, or may not be, the same system where the tests themselves are executing.

<p>This simple example above is <em>direct</em> communication. Communication to the browser may also be <em>remote</em> communication through Selenium Server or RemoteWebDriver. RemoteWebDriver runs on the same system as the driver and the browser.
</br>

<img src="images/remote_comms.png" width="400px" style="float:none">

<p>Remote communication can also take place using Selenium Server or Selenium Grid, both of which in turn talk to the driver on the host system
</br>
<img src="images/remote_comms_server.png" width="400px" >


<h3>Where Frameworks Fit In</h3>

<p>WebDriver has one job and one job only: communicate with the browser via any of the methods above. WebDriver doesn't know a thing about testing: it doesn't know how to compare things, assert pass or fail, and it certainly doesn't know a thing about reporting or Given/When/Then grammar.

<p>This is where various frameworks come in to play. At a minimum you'll need a test framework that matches the language bindings, eg NUnit for .NET, JUnit for Java, RSpec for Ruby, etc.

<p>The test framework is responsible for running and executing your WebDriver and related steps in your tests. As such, you can think of it looking akin to the following image.

</br>
<img src="images/test_framework.png" width="400px" style="float:none">

<p>Natural language frameworks/tools such as Cucumber may exist as part of that Test Framework box in the figure above, or they may wrap the Test Framework entirely in their own implementation.

<h2>Driver requirements</h2>

<p>Through WebDriver, Selenium supports all major browsers on the market
 such as Chrom(ium), Firefox, Internet Explorer, Opera, and Safari.
 Where possible, WebDriver drives the browser
 using the browser's built-in support for automation,
 although not all browsers have official support for remote control.

<p>WebDriver's aim is to emulate a real user's interaction
 with the browser as closely as possible.
 This is possible at varying levels in different browsers.
 For more details on the different driver idiosyncracies,
 please see <em><a href=drivers.html>Driver Idiosyncracies</a></em>.

<p>Even though all the drivers share a single user-facing interface
 for contolling the browser,
 they have slightly different ways of setting up browser sessions.
 Since many of the driver implementations are provided by third parties,
 they are not included in the standard Selenium distribution.

<p>Driver instantiation, profile management, and various browser specific settings
 are examples of parameters that have different requirements depending on the browser.
 This section explains the basic requirements
 for getting you started with the different browsers.

<h3>Adding Executables to your PATH</h3>
<p>Most drivers require an extra executable for Selenium to communicate
 with the browser. You can manually specify where the executable lives
 before starting WebDriver, but this can make your tests less portable,
 as the executables will need to be in the same place on every machine,
 or included within your test code repository.
<p>By adding a folder containing WebDriver's binaries to your system's
 path, Selenium will be able to locate the additional binaries without
 requiring your test code to locate the exact location of the driver.
<ul>
 <li>Create a directory to place the executables in, like
  <em>C:\WebDriver\bin</em> or <em>/opt/WebDriver/bin</em></li>
  <li>Add the directory to your PATH:
   <ul>
    <li>On Windows - Open a command prompt as administrator
     and the run the following command
     to permanently add the directory to your path
     for all users on your machine:
     <pre><code class=bat>setx /m path "%path%;C:\WebDriver\bin\"</code></pre>

    <li>Bash users on macOS and Linux - In a terminal:
    <pre><code class=shell>export PATH=$PATH:/opt/WebDriver/bin >> ~/.profile</code></pre>
   </ul>

 <li><p>You are now ready to test your changes.
  Close all open command prompts and open a new one.
  Type out the name of one of the binaries
  in the folder you created in the previous step,
  e.g: <pre><code class=shell>chromedriver</code></pre>
  If your <var>PATH</var> is configured correctly,
  you will see some some output relating to the startup of the driver:

  <p><pre><samp>Starting ChromeDriver 2.25.426935 (820a95b0b81d33e42712f9198c215f703412e1a1) on port 9515
Only local connections are allowed.</samp></pre>

  <p>You can regain control of your command prompt
   by pressing <kbd>Ctrl + C</kbd>.
</ul>

<h4>Chromium/Chrome</h4>

<p>To drive Chrome or Chromium, you have to download
 <a href=//sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads>chromedriver</a>
 and put it in a folder that is on your system's path.

<p>On Linux or macOS, this means modifying
 the <var>PATH</var> environmental variable.
 You can see what directories, separated by a colon,
 make up your system's path by executing the following command:

<pre><code class=shell>$ echo $PATH
/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin</code></pre>

<p>To include chromedriver on the path if it isn't already,
 make sure you include the chromedriver binary's parent directory.
 The following line will set the <var>PATH</var> environmental variable
 its current content, plus an additional path added after the colon:

<pre><code class=shell>$ export PATH="$PATH:/path/to/chromedriver"</code></pre>

<p>When chromedriver is available on your path,
 you should be able to execute the _chromedriver_ executable from any directory.

<p>To instantiate a Chrome/Chromium session, you can do the following:

<pre>
 <code class=java>WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();</code>
 <code class=python>from selenium.webdriver import Chrome
driver = Chrome()</code>
 <code class=ruby>driver = Selenium::WebDriver.for :chrome</code>
</pre>

<p>Remember that you have to set the path to the chromedriver executable.
 This is possible using the following line:

<pre>
 <code class=java>System.setProperty("webdriver.chrome.driver", "/path/to/chromedriver");</code>
 <code class=python>Chrome(executable_path='/path/to/chromedriver')</code>
 <code class=ruby>Selenium::WebDriver::Chrome.driver_path = "/path/to/chromedriver"</code>
</pre>

<p>The chromedriver is implemented as a WebDriver remote server
 that by exposing Chrome's internal automation proxy interface
 instructs the browser what to do.


<h3>Firefox</h3>

<p>Starting with Selenium 3, Mozilla has taken over implementation of
 Firefox Driver, with <a href=https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver>geckodriver</a>.
 The new driver for Firefox is called geckodriver and works with Firefox
 48 and newer. Since the Firefox WebDriver is under development, the
 newer the Firefox version the better the support.

<p>As geckodriver is the new default way of launching Firefox, you can
 instantiate Firefox in the same way as Selenium 2:

<pre>
 <code class=java>WebDriver driver = new FirefoxDriver();</code>
 <code class=python>from selenium.webdriver import Firefox
driver = Firefox()</code>
 <code class=ruby>driver = Selenium::WebDriver.for :firefox</code>
</pre>


<p>If you prefer not to set geckodriver's location using PATH,
 set the geckodriver binary location programmatically:

<pre>
  <code class=java>System.setProperty("webdriver.gecko.driver", "/path/to/geckodriver");</code>
  <code class=python>Firefox(executable_path='/path/to/geckodriver')</code>
  <code class=ruby>Selenium::WebDriver::Firefox.driver_path = "/path/to/geckodriver"</code>
</pre>

<p>It is also possible to set the property at run time:

<pre><code class=shell>mvn test -Dwebdriver.gecko.driver=/path/to/geckodriver</code></pre>

<p>It is currently possible to revert to the older, more feature complete
 Firefox driver, by installing Firefox
 <a href="https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/firefox/releases/47.0.1/">47.0.1</a>
 or <a href="https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/firefox/releases/45.0esr/">45 ESR</a>
 and specifying a desired capability of <strong>marionette</strong> as
 <strong>false</strong>. Later releases of Firefox are no longer compatible.


<h3>Edge</h3>

<p>Edge is Microsoft's newest browser, included with Windows 10 and Server 2016.
 Updates to Edge are bundled with major Windows updates,
 so you'll need to download a binary which matches the build number of your currently installed build of Windows.
 The <a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/webdriver/">Edge Developer site</a>
 contains links to all the available binaries. Bugs against the EdgeDriver implementation can be raised with
 <a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/platform/issues/?page=1&q=webdriver">Microsoft</a>.  If you'd like to run tests against Edge, but aren't running Windows 10, Microsoft offer free VMs for testers on the <a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/vms/"> Edge Developer site</a>.

<pre>
  <code class=java>WebDriver driver = new EdgeDriver();</code>
  <code class=python>from selenium.webdriver import Edge
driver = Edge()</code>
  <code class=ruby>driver = Selenium::WebDriver.for :edge</code>
</pre>

<p>If Edge driver is not present in your path, you can set the path using the following line:

<pre>
  <code class=java>System.setProperty("webdriver.edge.driver", "C:\path\to\MicrosoftWebDriver.exe");</code>
  <code class=python>Edge(executable_path='/path/to/MicrosoftWebDriver.exe')</code>
  <code class=ruby>Selenium::WebDriver::Edge.driver_path = "C:\path\to\MicrosoftWebDriver.exe"</code>
</pre>


<h3>Internet Explorer</h3>
<p>Internet Explorer was Microsoft's default browser until Windows 10, although it is still included in Windows 10. Internet Explorer Driver is the only driver The Selenium project aims to support the same releases
 <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/17454/lifecycle-support-policy-faq-internet-explorer">
  Microsoft considers current</a>. Older releases may work, but will be unsupported.
<p>While the Selenium project provides binaries for both the 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Internet Explorer, there are some <a href="http://jimevansmusic.blogspot.co.uk/2014/09/screenshots-sendkeys-and-sixty-four.html">limitations</a> with Internet Explorer 10 &amp; 11 with the 64-bit driver, but using the 32-bit driver continues to work well. It should be noted that as Internet Explorer preferences are saved against the logged in user's account, some <a href="https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/wiki/InternetExplorerDriver#required-configuration">additional setup is required</a>.

<pre>
  <code class=java>WebDriver driver = new InternetExplorerDriver();</code>
  <code class=python>from selenium.webdriver import Ie
driver = Ie()</code>
  <code class=ruby>driver = Selenium::WebDriver.for :ie</code>
</pre>

<p>If Internet Explorer driver is not present in your path, you can set the path using the following line:

<pre>
  <code class=java>System.setProperty("webdriver.ie.driver", "C:\path\to\IEDriver.exe");</code>
  <code class=python>Ie(executable_path='/path/to/IEDriverServer.exe')</code>
  <code class=ruby>Selenium::WebDriver::IE.driver_path = "C:\path\to\IEDriver.exe"</code>
</pre>

Microsoft also offer a WebDriver binary for <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/download/details.aspx?id=44069">Internet Explorer 11 on Windows 7 &amp; 8.1</a>. It has not been updated since 2014 and is based of a draft version of the W3 specification. <a href="http://jimevansmusic.blogspot.co.uk/2014/09/using-internet-explorer-webdriver.html">Jim Evans</a> has an excellent writeup on Microsoft's implementation.


<h3>Opera</h3>

<p>Current releases of Opera are built on top of the Chromium engine,
 and WebDriver is now supported via the closed-source
 <a href="https://github.com/operasoftware/operachromiumdriver/releases">Opera Chromium Driver</a>,
 which can be <a href="#adding_executables_to_your_path">added to your PATH</a>
 or as a system property.

<p>Instantiating a driver session is similar to Firefox and Chromium:

<pre>
 <code class=java>WebDriver driver = new OperaDriver();</code>
 <code class=python>from selenium.webdriver import Opera
driver = Opera()</code>
</pre>

<h3>Safari</h3>

<p>Starting with Safari 10 on macOS El Capitan and Sierra,
 WebDriver support is included with each release of the browser.
 To enable support:

<ol>
 <li>Enable the Developer menu from Safari preferences
 <li>Check the <em>Allow Remote Automation</em> option
  from with the Develop menu
 <li>Run <pre><code class=shell>/usr/bin/safaridriver -p 1337</code></pre> from the terminal
  for the first time and type your password
  at the prompt to authorise WebDriver
</ol>

<p>You can then start a driver session using:
<pre>
  <code class=java>WebDriver driver = new SafariDriver();</code>
  <code class=python>from selenium.webdriver import Safari
driver = Safari()</code>
  <code class=ruby>driver = Selenium::WebDriver.for :safari</code>
</pre>

<p>Those looking to automate Safari on iOS should look to the
 <a href="http://appium.io/">Appium project</a>. Whilst Safari was previously
 available for Windows, Apple has long since dropped support, making it
 a poor choice of test platform.


<h3>Mock browsers</h3>


<h4>HtmlUnit</h4>

<p>HtmlUnit is a "GUI-Less browser for Java programs". It models HTML documents and provides an API that allows you
to invoke pages, fill out forms, click links, etc. It has JavaScript support and is able to work with AJAX libraries,
simulating Chrome, Firefox or Internet Explorer depending on the configuration used. It has been moved to a
<a href="http://htmlunit.sourceforge.net/gettingStarted.html">new</a> location.</p> The source is maintained on svn.


<h4>PhantomJS</h4>

<p>PhantomJS is a headless browser based on Webkit, albeit a version much older than that used by Google Chrome or
 Safari. <!-- Unlike HtmlUnit driver, it also supports Javascript ()-->. Whilst historically a popular choice, it would now be
 wise to avoid PhantomJS. The project has been unmaintained
 <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/phantomjs/9aI5d-LDuNE">since the 5th of August</a>, so whilst the web
 will continue to change, PhantomJS will not be updated.  This was after Google announced the ability to run Chrome
 headlessly, something also now offered by Mozilla&apos;s Firefox.</p>

<h2>Browser launching and manipulation</h2>

<!-- #codeExamples -->
<!-- Remember to cover profile and extensions here -->


<h3>Ruby</h3>

<p>Ruby is not installed by default on Windows. Download the latest <a href="http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads">version</a> and run the installer. You can leave all settings at default values, except at the <em>Installation Destination and Optional Tasks</em> screen check <em>Add Ruby executables to your PATH</em> checkbox. To drive any browser, you have to install selenium-webdriver Ruby gem. To install it, open command prompt and type this:

<pre><code class=shell>$ gem install selenium-webdriver</code></pre>

Or, if you use <a href="https://bundler.io">Bundler</a>, add this line to your application's Gemfile:

<pre><code class=ruby>gem "selenium-webdriver"</code></pre>

And then execute the following command in prompt:

<pre><code class=shell>$ bundle install</code></pre>

<h3>Internet Explorer</h3>

<p>Internet Explorer is installed by default on Windows, so no installation is needed. To drive Internet Explorer on Windows, you have to download the latest <a href="http://www.seleniumhq.org/download/">Internet Explorer Driver</a> and put the file into a folder that is in PATH. To find out which directories are in PATH, type <em>echo %PATH%</em> in command prompt.

<pre><code class=bat>$ echo %PATH%
C:\Ruby200\bin;C:\WINDOWS\system32;C:\WINDOWS;C:\WINDOWS\System32\Wbem</code></pre>

<em>C:\Ruby200\bin</em> looks like a good place. Unzip `IEDriverServer` file and move `IEDriverServer.exe` there.

This should open a new Internet Explorer window:

<pre><code class=ruby>require "selenium-webdriver"
driver = Selenium::WebDriver.for :internet_explorer</code></pre>

<h2>Browser Navigation</h2>

<h3>Navigate To</h3>

<p>The first thing you will want to do after launching a browser is to
 open your website. This can be achieved in a single line:

<pre>
 <code class=java>
//Convenient
driver.get("https://www.seleniumhq.org");

//Longer way
driver.navigate().to("https://seleniumhq.github.io/docs/");
 </code>
 <code class=python>driver.get("https://www.seleniumhq.org")</code>
 <code class=ruby>
# Convenient
driver.get 'https://www.seleniumhq.org'

# Longer way
driver.navigate.to 'https://seleniumhq.github.io/docs/'
 </code>
 <code class=cs>this.driver.Navigate().GoToUrl(@"http://google.com");</code>
</pre>

<h3>Get Current URL</h3>

<p>You can read the current URL from the browser&apos;s address bar
 using:</p>
<pre>
 <code class=java>driver.getCurrentUrl();</code>
 <code class=python>driver.current_url</code>
 <code class=ruby>driver.current_url</code>
 <code class=cs>this.driver.Url;</code>
</pre>

<h3>Back</h3>
<p>Pressing the browser&apos;s back button:
<pre>
 <code class=java>driver.navigate().back();</code>
 <code class=python>driver.back()</code>
 <code class=ruby>driver.navigate.back</code>
 <code class=cs>this.driver.Navigate().Back();</code>
</pre>

<h3>Forward</h3>
<p>Pressing the browser&apos;s forward button:
 <pre>
  <code class=java>driver.navigate().forward();</code>
  <code class=python>driver.forward()</code>
  <code class=ruby>driver.navigate.forward</code>
  <code class=cs>this.driver.Navigate().Forward();</code>
 </pre>

<h3>Refresh</h3>
<p>Refresh the current page:
<pre>
  <code class=java>driver.navigate().refresh();</code>
  <code class=python>driver.refresh()</code>
  <code class=ruby>driver.navigate.refresh</code>
  <code class=cs>this.driver.Navigate().Refresh();</code>
 </pre>

<h3>Get Title</h3>
<p>You can read the current page title from the browser:</p>
<pre>
  <code class=java>driver.getTitle();</code>
  <code class=python>driver.title</code>
  <code class=ruby>driver.title</code>
  <code class=cs>this.driver.Title;</code>
 </pre>

<h2>Waits</h2>

<p>WebDriver can generally be said to have a blocking API.
 Because it is an out-of-process library that
 <em>instructs</em> the browser what to do,
 and because the web platform has an intrinsically asynchronous nature,
 WebDriver doesn't track the active, real-time state of the DOM.
 This comes with some challenges that we will discuss here.

<p>From experience,
 most intermittents that arise from use of Selenium and WebDriver
 are connected to <em>race conditions</em> that occur between
 the browser and the user's instructions.
 An example could be that the user instructs the browser to navigate to a page,
 then gets a <strong>no such element</strong> error
 when trying to find an element.

<p>Consider the following document:

<pre><code class=html>&lt;!doctype html&gt;
&lt;meta charset=utf-8&gt;
&lt;title&gt;Race Condition Example&lt;title&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
  var initialised = false;
  window.addEventListener("load", function() {
    var newElement = document.createElement("p");
    newElement.textContent = "Hello from JavaScript!";
    document.body.appendChild(newElement);
    initialised = true;
  });
&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>

<p>The WebDriver instructions might look innocent enough:

<pre>
<code class=python>driver.navigate("file:///race_condition.html")
el = driver.find_element_by_tag_name("p")
assert el.text == "Hello from JavaScript!"</code>
<code class=java>
driver.get("file:///race_condition.html");
WebElement element = driver.findElement(By.tagName("p"));
assertEquals(element.getText(), "Hello from JavaScript!");
</code>
</pre>

<p>The issue here is that the default
 <a href=#page_load_strategy>page load strategy</a>
 used in WebDriver listens for the <var>document.readyState</var>
 to change to <code>"complete"</code> before returning from the call to <em>navigate</em>.
 Because the <code>p</code> element is
 added <em>after</em> the document has completed loading,
 this WebDriver script <em>might</em> be intermittent.
 It “might” be intermittent because no guarantees can be made
 about elements or events that trigger asynchronously
 without explicitly waiting&mdash;or blocking&mdash;on those events.

<p>Fortunately, using the normal instruction set available on
 the <em><a href=#webelement>WebElement</a></em> interface&mdash;such
 as <em>WebElement.click</em> and <em>WebElement.sendKeys</em>&mdash;are
 guaranteed to be synchronous,
 in that the function calls won't return
 (or the callback won't trigger in callback-style languages)
 until the command has been completed in the browser.
 The advanced user interaction APIs,
 <em><a href=#keyboard>Keyboard</a></em> and
 <em><a href=#mouse>Mouse</a></em>,
 are exceptions as they are explicitly intended as
 “do what I say” asynchronous commands.

<p>Waiting is having the automated task execution
 elapse a certain amount of time before continuing with the next step.

<p>To overcome the problem of race conditions
 between the browser and your WebDriver script,
 most Selenium clients ship with a <em>wait</em> package.
 When employing a wait,
 you are using what is commonly referred to
 as an <em><a href=#explicit_wait>explicit wait</a></em>.


<h3>Explicit waiting</h3>

<p><em>Explicit waits</em> are available to Selenium clients
 for imperative, procedural languages.
 They allow your code to halt program execution,
 or freeze the thread,
 until the <em>condition</em> you pass it resolves.
 The condition is called with a certain frequency
 until the timeout of the wait is elapsed.
 This means that for as long as the condition returns a falsy value,
 it will keep trying and waiting.

<p>Since explicit waits allow you to wait for a condition to occur,
 they make a good fit for synchronising the state between the browser and its DOM,
 and your WebDriver script.

<p>To remedy our buggy instruction set from earlier,
 we could employ a wait to have the <em>findElement</em> call
 wait until the dynamically added element from the script
 has been added to the DOM:

<pre><code class=python>from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait

def document_initialised(driver):
    return driver.execute_script("return initialised")

driver.navigate("file:///race_condition.html")
WebDriverWait(driver).until(document_initialised)
el = driver.find_element_by_tag_name("p")
assert el.text == "Hello from JavaScript!"</code></pre>

<p>We pass in the <em>condition</em> as a function reference
 that the <em>wait</em> will run repeatedly until its return value is truthy.
 A “truthful” return value is anything that evaluates to boolean true
 in the language at hand, such as a string, number, a boolean,
 an object (including a <em>WebElement</em>),
 or a populated (non-empty) sequence or list.
 That means an <em>empty list</em> evaluates to false.
 When the condition is truthful and the blocking wait is aborted,
 the return value from the condition becomes the return value of the wait.

<p>With this knowledge,
 and because the wait utility ignores <em>no such element</em> errors by default,
 we can refactor our instructions to be more concise:

<pre><code class=python>from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait

driver.navigate("file:///race_condition.html")
el = WebDriverWait(driver).until(lambda d: return d.find_element_by_tag_name("p"))
assert el.text == "Hello from JavaScript!"</code></pre>

<p>In that example, we pass in an anonymous function
 (but we could also define it explicitly as we did earlier so it may be reused).
 The first and only argument that is passed to our condition
 is always a reference to our driver object, <em>WebDriver</em>
 (called <em>d</em> in the example).
 In a multi-threaded environment, you should be careful
 to operate on the driver reference passed in to the condition
 rather than the reference to the driver in the outer scope.

<p>Because the wait will swallow <em>no such element</em> errors
 that are raised when the element isn't found,
 the condition will retry until the element is found.
 Then it will take the return value, a <em>WebElement</em>,
 and pass it back through to our script.

<p>If the condition fails,
 e.g. a truthful return value from the condition is never reached,
 the wait will throw/raise an error/exception called a <em>timeout error</em>.


<h4>Options</h4>

<p>The wait condition can be customised to match your needs.
 Sometimes it's unnecessary to wait the full extent of the default timeout,
 as the penalty for not hitting a successful condition can be expensive.

<p>The wait lets you pass in an argument to override the timeout:

<pre><code class=python>WebDriverWait(driver, timeout=3).until(some_condition)</code></pre>


<h4>Expected conditions</h4>

<p>Because it's quite a common occurrence
 to have to synchronise the DOM and your instructions,
 most clients also come with a set of predefined <em>expected conditions</em>.
 As might be obvious by the name,
 they are conditions that are predefined for frequent wait operations.

<p>The conditions available in the different language bindings vary,
 but this is a non-exhaustive list of a few:

<!-- TODO(ato): Fill in -->
<dl>
 <dt>alert is present
 <dd>

 <dt>element exists
 <dd>

 <dt>element is visible
 <dd>

 <dt>title contains
 <dd>

 <dt>title is
 <dd>

 <dt>element staleness
 <dd>

 <dt>visible text
 <dd>
</dl>

<p>You can refer to the API documentation for each client binding
 to find an exhaustive list of expected conditions:

<ul>
 <li>Java's <code><a href=//seleniumhq.github.io/selenium/docs/api/java/org/openqa/selenium/support/ui/ExpectedConditions.html>org.openqa.selenium.support.ui.ExpectedConditions</a></code> class
 <li>Python's <code><a href="//seleniumhq.github.io/selenium/docs/api/py/webdriver_support/selenium.webdriver.support.expected_conditions.html?highlight=expected">selenium.webdriver.support.expected_conditions</a></code> class
 <li>.NET's <code><a href=//seleniumhq.github.io/selenium/docs/api/dotnet/html/T_OpenQA_Selenium_Support_UI_ExpectedConditions.htm>OpenQA.Selenium.Support.UI.ExpectedConditions</a></code> type
</ul>


<h3>Implicit waiting</h3>

<p>There is a second type of wait that is distinct from
 <a href=#explicit_wait>explicit waits</a> called <em>implicit waiting</em>.
 By implicitly waiting, WebDriver polls the DOM
 for a certain duration when trying to find <em>any</em> element.
 This can be useful when certain elements on the webpage
 are not available immediately and need some time to load.

<p>Implicit waiting for elements to appear is disabled by default
 and will need to be manually enabled on a per-session basis.
 Mixing <a href=#explicit_wait>explicit waits</a> and implicit waiting
 will cause unintended consequences,
 namely waits sleeping for the maximum time
 even if the element is available or condition is true.

<p><strong>Warning:</strong>
 Do not mix implicit and explicit waits.
 Doing so can cause unpredictable wait times.
 For example, setting an implicit wait of 10 seconds
 and an explicit wait of 15 seconds
 could cause a timeout to occur after 20 seconds.

<p>An implicit wait is to tell WebDriver to poll the DOM
 for a certain amount of time when trying to find an element or elements
 if they are not immediately available.
 The default setting is 0, meaning disabled.
 Once set, the implicit wait is set for the life of the session.

<pre><code class=java>WebDriver driver = new FirefoxDriver();
driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(10, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
driver.get("http://somedomain/url_that_delays_loading");
WebElement myDynamicElement = driver.findElement(By.id("myDynamicElement"));</code></pre>


<h4>FluentWait</h4>

<p>FluentWait instance defines the maximum amount of time to wait for a condition,
 as well as the frequency with which to check the condition.

<p>Users may configure the wait to ignore specific types of exceptions whilst waiting,
 such as <code>NoSuchElementException</code>s when searching for an element on the page.

<pre><code class=java>// Waiting 30 seconds for an element to be present on the page, checking
// for its presence once every 5 seconds.
Wait&lt;WebDriver&gt; wait = new FluentWait&lt;WebDriver&gt;(driver)
  .withTimeout(30, SECONDS)
  .pollingEvery(5, SECONDS)
  .ignoring(NoSuchElementException.class);

WebElement foo = wait.until(new Function&lt;WebDriver, WebElement&gt;() {
  public WebElement apply(WebDriver driver) {
    return driver.findElement(By.id("foo"));
  }
});</code></pre>

<pre><code class=java>FluentWait&lt;By&gt; fluentWait = new FluentWait&lt;By&gt;(By.tagName("TEXTAREA"));
fluentWait.pollingEvery(100, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS);
fluentWait.withTimeout(1000, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS);
fluentWait.until(new Predicate&lt;By&gt;() {
  public boolean apply(By by) {
    try {
      return browser.findElement(by).isDisplayed();
    } catch (NoSuchElementException ex) {
      return false;
    }
  }
});
browser.findElement(By.tagName("TEXTAREA")).sendKeys("text to enter");</code></pre>

<h2>JavaScript Alerts, Prompts and Confirmations</h2>

<p>WebDriver provides an API for working with the three types of native
 popup message offered by JavaScript. These popups are styled by the
 browser and offer limited customisation.

<h3>Alerts</h3>

<p>The simplest of these is referred to as an alert, which shows a
 custom message, and a single button which dismisses the alert, labelled
 in most browsers as OK. It can also be dismissed in most browsers by
 pressing the close button, but this will always do the same thing as
 the OK button. <a onclick="window.alert('Sample alert')">See an example alert</a>.

<p>WebDriver can get the text from the popup and accept or dismiss these
 alerts.

<pre>
 <code class=java>
//Click the link to activate the alert
driver.findElement(By.linkText("See an example alert")).click();

//Wait for the alert to be displayed and store it in a variable
Alert alert = wait.until(ExpectedConditions.alertIsPresent());

//Store the alert text in a variable
String text = alert.getText();

//Press the OK button
alert.accept();
 </code>
 <code class="python">
# Click the link to activate the alert
driver.find_element_by_link_text("See an example alert").click()

# Wait for the alert to be displayed and store it in a variable
alert = wait.until(expected_conditions.alert_is_present())

# Store the alert text in a variable
text = alert.text

# Press the OK button
alert.accept()
 </code>
</pre>

<h3>Confirm</h3>

<p>A confirm box is similar to an alert, except the user can also choose
 to cancel the message. <a onclick="window.confirm('Are you sure?')">See
 a sample confirm</a>.

<p>This example also shows a different approach to storing an alert:

<pre>
 <code class=java>
//Click the link to activate the alert
driver.findElement(By.linkText("See a sample confirm")).click();

//Wait for the alert to be displayed
wait.until(ExpectedConditions.alertIsPresent());

//Store the alert in a variable
Alert alert = driver.switchTo().alert();

//Store the alert in a variable for reuse
String text = alert.getText();

//Press the Cancel button
alert.dismiss();
 </code>
 <code class="python">
# Click the link to activate the alert
driver.find_element_by_link_text("See a sample confirm").click()

# Wait for the alert to be displayed
wait.until(expected_conditions.alert_is_present())

# Store the alert in a variable for reuse
alert = driver.switch_to.alert

# Store the alert text in a variable
text = alert.text

# Press the Cancel button
alert.dismiss()
 </code>
</pre>

<h3>Prompt</h3>

<p>Prompts are similar to confirm boxes, except they also include a text
 input. Similar to working with form elements, you can use WebDriver&apos;s
 send keys to fill in a response. This will completely replace the placeholder
 text. Pressing the cancel button will not submit any text.
 <a onclick="window.prompt('What is your tool of choice?',navigator.appName)">
 See a sample prompt</a>.

<pre>
 <code class=java>
//Click the link to activate the alert
driver.findElement(By.linkText("See a sample prompt")).click();

//Wait for the alert to be displayed and store it in a variable
Alert alert = wait.until(ExpectedConditions.alertIsPresent());

//Type your message
alert.sendKeys("Selenium");

//Press the OK button
alert.accept();
 </code>
 <code class="python">
# Click the link to activate the alert
driver.find_element_by_link_text("See a sample prompt").click()

# Wait for the alert to be displayed
wait.until(expected_conditions.alert_is_present())

# Store the alert in a variable for reuse
alert = Alert(driver)

# Type your message
alert.send_keys("Selenium")

# Press the OK button
alert.accept()
 </code>
</pre>

<h2>Page loading strategy</h2>

<h2>Web elements</h2>

<p>Represents a DOM element. WebElements can be found by searching from the
 document root using a WebDriver instance, or by searching under another
 WebElement:

<pre><code class=javascript>driver.get('http://www.google.com')
    .then(() =>   driver.findElement(By.tagName('form')) )
    .then((searchForm) => searchForm.findElement(By.name('q')) )
    .then((searchBox) => searchBox.sendKeys('webdriver') );</code></pre>

Remote WebDriver
================

You can use Remote webdriver the same way you would use webdriver locally. The primary difference is that
remote webdriver needs to be configured so that it can run your tests on a seperate machine.

The RemoteWebDriver is composed of two pieces: a client and a server. The client is your WebDriver test and the server is simply a Java servlet, which can be hosted in any modern JEE app server. 

The RemoteWebDriver Server
===========================
The server will always run on the machine with the browser you want to test. There are two ways to user the server: command line or configured in code.

Starting the Server from The Command Line
------------------------------------------
Once you have downloaded selenium-server-standalone-{VERSION}.jar place it on the computer with the browser you want to test. Then from the directory with the jar run the following
```
java -jar selenium-server-standalone-{VERSION}.jar
```
Considerations when running server
-----------------------------------
The caller is expected to terminate each session properly, calling either Selenium#stop() or WebDriver#quit.

The selenium-server keeps in-memory logs for each ongoing session, which are cleared when Selenium#stop() or WebDriver#quit is called. If you forget to terminate these sessions your server may leak memory. If you keep extremely long-running sessions you will probably need to stop/quit every now and then (or increase memory with -Xmx jvm option)

Timeouts (from version 2.21)
----------------------------
The server has two different timeouts, which can be set as follows:
```
java -jar selenium-server-standalone-{VERSION}.jar -timeout=20 -browserTimeout=60
```
- browserTimeout: Controls how long the browser is allowed to hang (value in seconds)
- timeout: Controls how long the client is is allowed to be gone before the session is reclaimed (value in seconds)
- System property: "selenium.server.session.timeout" is no longer supported as of 2.21.

Please note that the "browserTimeout" is intended as a backup timeout mechanism when the ordinary timeout mechanism fails, which should be used mostly in grid/server environments to ensure that crashed/lost processes do not stay around for too long, polluting the runtime environment.

Configuring the Server in Code
------------------------------
In theory, the process is as simple as mapping the "DriverServlet" to a URL, but it's also possible to host the page in a lightweight container, such as Jetty configured entirely in code. Steps to do this follow.

Download the "selenium-server.zip" and unpack. Put the JARs on the CLASSPATH
Create a new class called "AppServer". Here, I'm using Jetty, so you'll need to download that as well:
```java
import org.mortbay.jetty.Connector;
import org.mortbay.jetty.Server;
import org.mortbay.jetty.nio.SelectChannelConnector;
import org.mortbay.jetty.security.SslSocketConnector;
import org.mortbay.jetty.webapp.WebAppContext;

import javax.servlet.Servlet;
import java.io.File;

import org.openqa.selenium.remote.server.DriverServlet;

public class AppServer {
  private Server server = new Server();

  public AppServer() throws Exception {
    WebAppContext context = new WebAppContext();
    context.setContextPath("");
    context.setWar(new File("."));
    server.addHandler(context);

    context.addServlet(DriverServlet.class, "/wd/*");

    SelectChannelConnector connector = new SelectChannelConnector();
    connector.setPort(3001);
    server.addConnector(connector);

    server.start();
  }
}
```

Running RemoteWebDriver Client
===============================

First we need to connect to remote webdriver. We do this by pointing the url to the address of the 
server running our tests. In order to customize our configuration, we set desired capabilities.
Below is an example of instantiating a remote webdriver object pointing to our remote web server, 
www.example.com, running our tests on Firefox.


```ruby
require 'selenium-webdriver'

driver = Selenium::WebDriver.for :remote, :url => "http://www.example.com", :desired_capabilities => :firefox
driver.get "http://www.google.com"
driver.close
```

To further customize our test configuration we can add additional desired capabilities.


Desired Capabilities
--------------------

Desired capabilities can be expanded further. All RemoteWebdriver capabilities are sent through 
JsonWireProtocol. For a list of configurable capabilities, and more information on JsonWireProtocol,
please visit the documentation here: https://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/DesiredCapabilities

For example, suppose you wanted to run chrome on Windows XP, using Chrome version 27
   
```ruby
caps = Selenium::WebDriver::Remote::Capabilities.chrome
caps.platform = Windows XP
caps.version = 27

driver = Selenium::WebDriver.for :remote, :url => "http://www.example.com", :desired_capabilities => caps
```

Local File Detector
-------------------

The Local File Detector allows the transfer of files from the client machine to the remote server. 
For example if a test needs to upload a file to a web application, RemoteWebDriver can automatically 
transfer the file from the local machine to the remote web server during runtime. This allows the file to be 
uploaded from the remote machine running the test. It is not enabled by default and can 
be enabled in the following way:

Java:
```java
driver.setFileDetector(new LocalFileDetector());
```

Ruby:
```ruby
@driver.file_detector = lambda do |args|
         # args => ["/path/to/file"]
         str = args.first.to_s
         str if File.exist?(str)
end
```

Once the above code is defined, you can upload a file in your test in the following way:

Java:
```java
driver.get("http://sso.dev.saucelabs.com/test/guinea-file-upload");
WebElement upload = driver.findElement(By.id("myfile"));
upload.sendKeys("/Users/sso/the/local/path/to/darkbulb.jpg");
```

Ruby:
```ruby
@driver.navigate.to "http://sso.dev.saucelabs.com/test/guinea-file-upload"
element = @driver.find_element(:id, 'myfile')
element.send_keys "/Users/sso/SauceLabs/sauce/hostess/maitred/maitred/public/images/darkbulb.jpg"
```

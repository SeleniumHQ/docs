<h1>Quick tour</h1>

<p>Selenium is not just one tool or API
 but it composes many tools.


<h2>WebDriver</h2>

<p><em><a href=wd.html>WebDriver</a></em>, is also known as Selenium
2. If you are beginning with desktop website test automation then you
are going to be using WebDriver APIs. WebDriver uses browser
automation APIs provided by browser vendors to control browser and
run tests. This is as if real user is operating the browser. Since
WebDriver does not require its API to be compiled with application
code hence it is not intrusive in nature. Hence you are testing the
same application which you push live.


<h2>Selenium Grid</h2>

<p> Soon after development of WebDriver tests you may face the need to
 run your tests on multiple combinations of browser/operating
 system. This is where <em><a href=grid.html>Selenium Grid</a></em>
 comes to the rescue.


<h2>Selenium IDE</h2>

<p><em><a href=ide.html>Selenium IDE</a></em>, is a
 firefox extension  which can be used to record test steps on a firefox
 browser. Selenium IDE can be used to generate <i>quick and dirty</i>
 test code and convert in a variety of programming languages (i.e. c#,
 java, python and ruby). Given the maintainability of code generated
 through Selenium IDE, it is not recommended to use it for anything
 more than getting acquainted with element locators or generating
 <i>throw away code</i>. We are sure that once you get used to
 WebDriver API then you will never use Selenium IDE.


<h2>Selenium Remote Control</h2>

<p><em>Selenium Remote Control</em>, is also known
 as Selenium 1. Selenium RC was the most prominent Selenium tool
 before the advent of Selenium WebDriver. Selenium RC would use a
 proxy server and inject javascript in browser to be able to control
 it. Given the intrusive nature Selenium RC had on the browser,
 you were never sure if you are pushing the same application live that
 you had tested.

<p>It is currently possible to run older RC tests using Selenium 3, by
 including the <em>leg-rc</em> package in your project, which implements
 RC's interfaces using WebDriver. Leg-rc acts as a stop gap for anyone
 who have not yet moved to WebDriver, with the main goal being
 compatibility. Those looking for the best support and latest features
 are encouraged to <a href=rctowd.html>migrate</a> fully to WebDriver.
 It is strongly recommended to start any new project using Selenium
 WebDriver APIs.

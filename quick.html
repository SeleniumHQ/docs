<h1>Quick Tour</h1>
Selenium is not just one tool or API but it composes many tools -

<h2>WebDriver</h2>

<p><em><a href=wd.html>WebDriver</a></em>, is also known as Selenium
2. If you are beginning with desktop website test automation then you
are going to be using WebDriver APIs. WebDriver uses browser
automation APIs provided by browser vendors to control browser and
run tests. This is as if real user is operating the browser. Since
WebDriver does not require its API to be compiled with application
code hence it is not intrusive in nature. Hence you are testing the
same application which you push live.

<h2>Selenium Remote Control</h2>

<p><em><a href=rc.html>Selenium Remote Control</a></em>, is also known
as Selenium 1. Selenium RC was the most prominent Selenium tool
before the advent of Selenium WebDriver. Selenium RC would use a
proxy server and inject java script in browser to be able to control
it. Given the intrusive nature Selenium RC had on browser,
you were never sure if you are pushing the same application live what
you tested. Selenium 2 APIs yet contain Selenium RC APIs but
Selenium 3 would completely get rid of Selenium RC APIs. If you are
still using Selenium RC then you must
<em><a href=rctowd.html>migrate</a></em> to Selenium WebDriver.

<h2>Selenium IDE</h2>

<p><em><a href=ide.html>Selenium IDE</a></em>, is a
firefox plugin which can be used to record test steps on a firefox
browser. Selenium IDE can be used to generate <i>quick and dirty</i>
 test code and convert in a variety of programming languages (i.e. c#,
java, python and ruby). Given the maintainability of code generated
through Selenium IDE, it is not recommended to use it for any thing
more than getting acquainted with element locators or generating
<i>throw away code</i>. We are sure that once you get used to
WebDriver API then you will never use Selenium IDE.


<h2>Selenium Grid</h2>

<p> Soon after development of WebDriver tests you may face need of
running your test on multiple combinations of browser/operating
system. This is where <em><a href=grid.html>Selenium Grid</a></em>
comes to rescue.

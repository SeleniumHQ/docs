# [Selenium documentation rewrite](https://seleniumhq.github.io/docs/) 
[![Travis Status](https://travis-ci.com/SeleniumHQ/docs.svg?branch=gh-pages)](//travis-ci.com/SeleniumHQ/docs/builds)

Weâ€™re rewriting the Selenium documentation from scratch!
You can see the current progress of [our draft](//seleniumhq.github.io/docs),
and help us out by sending a patch.

Once this documentation reaches
a state of relative stability and completeness,
it will replace [the existing Selenium documentation](http://docs.seleniumhq.org/docs/),
which is severely lagging
behind the real state that Selenium is in.

We accept patches and pull requests on GitHub.
When opening a pull request,
please indicate that you have signed the

which is necessary to contribute to the Selenium project.

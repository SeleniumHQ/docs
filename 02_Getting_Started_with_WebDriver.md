Getting Started with WebDriver
==============================

Supported Browsers
------------------
WebDriver supports automation of the all main browsers in the market.
Automation bits for each browser are called __Drivers__. Some drivers are built
inside the browser, others are built and maintained by the Selenium developers.
More details about Drivers can be found in the Drivers (section[Different Drivers and Requirements]).

| Browser | Implementation | Versions Supported
| ------- | -------------- | ------------------
| Firefox | Selenium project. Firefox Plugin | 4 and newer
| Google Chrome | Chromium Devs. Built-in | All versions
| Opera | Opera. Built-in | 9 and newer
| Safari | Selenium project. Safari Plugin | 5.1 and newer
| Internet Explorer | Selenium project. COM | 6 and newer

Locating Elements
-----------------
<!-- #codeExamples -->
<!-- Cover all types of locators -->
Sometimes you can't select an item in a dropdown menu with two clicks (clicking the menu open, then clicking the menu item). That element might be located by nesting find_elements:
```ruby
@driver.find_element(:id, 'my_dropdown').find_element(:id, 'my_menu_item').click
```
Acting on the AUT
-----------------
<!-- Setting elements text, clicking, drag&drop, running javascript, etc. -->

Reading Page State
------------------
<!-- Getting element text and attributes, running javascript, etc. -->

Grabbing Screenshots
--------------------

<h1>Selenium Grid</h1>

<p><em>Selenium Grid</em> is a smart proxy server
 that allows Selenium tests to route commands to remote web browser instances.
 Its aim is to provide an easy way to run tests in parallel on multiple machines.

<p>With Selenium Grid,
 one server acts as the hub that routes JSON formatted test commands
 to one or more registered Grid nodes.
 Tests contact the hub to obtain access to remote browser instances.
 The hub has a list of registered servers that it provides access to,
 and allows us to control these instances.

<p>Selenium Grid allows us to run tests in parallel on multiple machines,
 and to manage different browser versions and browser configurations centrally
 (instead of in each individual test).

<h2>Pros and cons</h2>

<p>Selenium Grid isn't a silver bullet.
 It solves a subset of common delegation and distribution problems,
 but will for example not manage your infrastructure
 and might not suit your specific needs.


<h3>Pros</h3>

<dl>
 <dt>Scale</dt>
 <dd>Scale by distributing tests on several machines
  using parallel execution.</dd>

 <dt>Central</dt>
 <dd>Manage multiple environments from a central point,
  making it easy to run the tests against a large combination
  of browsers and operating systems.</dd>

 <dt>Minimize</dt>
 <dd>Minimize the maintenance time for the grid
  by allowing you to implement custom hooks
  to leverage a virtual infrastructure of registered nodes.</dd>

 <dt>Cross-Platform</dt>
 <dd>If your tests are running on one particular platform,
  by using a node on another platform
  you effectively have cross-platform testing.</dd>

 <dt>Smart</dt>
 <dd>Grid can route commands to a certain version of a browser
  if you have two or more nodes registered,
  each pointing to a different version of the browser binary.</dd>
</dl>


<h3>Cons</h3>

<dl>
 <dt>Prompted input</dt>
 <dd>You have no capabilities for user input
  if your tests want to prompt for user input
  whereas you would if your tests ran locally.</dd>

 <dt>Maintainability</dt>
 <dd>You also need to maintain the health
  of other computer systems which run your nodes.</dd>

 <dt>Limited power</dt>
 <dd>Certain third party libraries have limitations
  that prevent them from being used in conjunction with Grid.</dd>
</dl>

<h2>What is a hub and node?</h2>

<p>A <em>hub</em> is a central point
 from where your tests will be kicked off.
 There will only be one hub in a grid
 and it's launched from one system.
 The hub will connect one or more nodes
 that tests will be delegated to.

<p><em>Nodes</em> are different Selenium instances
 that will execute tests on individual computer systems.
 There can be many nodes in a grid.
 The machines which are nodes need not be the same platform
 or have the same browser selection as that of the hub or the other nodes.
 A node on Windows might have the capability of
 offering Internet Explorer as a browser option,
 whereas this wouldn't be possible on Linux or Mac.

<h2>Rolling your own grid</h2>

<p>To use Selenium Grid,
 you must maintain your own infrastructure for the nodes.
 Without this infrastructure, Grid will not function.
 Many organizations use IaaS providers
 such as Amazon EC2 and Google Compute
 to provide this infrastructure.

<p>Other options include outsourcing the infrastructure management
 to providers such as Sauce Labs or Testing Bot.
 They provide grid nodes as a service,
 but it's certainly possible to also run nodes on your own hardware.
 This chapter will go into detail about the option of rolling your own grid,
 complete with its own node infrastructure.


<h3>Quick start</h3>

<p>This example will show you how to start the Selenium 2 Hub,
 and register both a WebDriver node and a Selenium 1 RC legacy node.
 We’ll also show you how to call the grid from Java.
 The hub and nodes are shown here running on the same machine,
 but of course you can copy the selenium-server-standalone to multiple machines.

<p>The <em>selenium-server-standalone</em> package includes the hub,
 WebDriver, and legacy RC needed to run the grid.
 <em>ant</em> is not required anymore.
 You can download the <em>selenium-server-standalone-.jar</em> from
 <a href=http://www.seleniumhq.org/download/>http://www.seleniumhq.org/download/</a>.


<h4>Step 1: Start the hub</h4>

<p>The hub is the central point that will receive test requests
 and distribute them to the right nodes.
 The distribution is done on a capabilities basis,
 meaning a test requiring a set of capabilities
 will only be distributed to nodes offering that set or subset of capabilities.

<p>Because a test's desired capabilities are just what the name implies, <em>desired</em>,
 the hub cannot guarantee that it will locate a node
 fully matching the requested desired capabilities set.

<p>Open a command prompt
 and navigate to the directory where you copied
 the <em>selenium-server-standalone.jar</em> file.
 You start the hub by passing the <code>-role hub</code> flag
 to the standalone server:

<pre><code>$ java -jar selenium-server-standalone.jar -role hub</code></pre>

<p>The hub will listen to port 4444 by default.
 You can view the status of the hub by opening a browser window and navigating to
 <a href=http://localhost:4444/grid/console>http://localhost:4444/grid/console</a>.

<p>To change the default port,
 you can add the optional <code>-port</code> flag
 with an integer representing the port to listen to when you run the command.
 Also, all of the other options you see in the JSON config file (seen below)
 are possible command-line flags.

<p>You certainly can get by with only the simple command shown above,
 but if you need more advanced configuration,
 then you may also for convenience specify a JSON format config file
 to configure the hub when you start it.
 You can do it like so:

<pre><code>$ java -jar selenium-server-standalone.jar -role hub -hubConfig hubConfig.json -debug</code></pre>

<p>Below you will see an example of a <em>hubConfig.json</em> file.
 We will go into more detail on how to provide node configuration files in step 2.

<pre><code class=json>{"_comment" : "Configuration for Hub - hubConfig.json",
  "host": ip,
  "maxSessions": 5,
  "port": 4444,
  "cleanupCycle": 5000,
  "timeout": 300000,
  "newSessionWaitTimeout": -1,
  "servlets": [],
  "prioritizer": null,
  "capabilityMatcher": "org.openqa.grid.internal.utils.DefaultCapabilityMatcher",
  "throwOnCapabilityNotPresent": true,
  "nodePolling": 180000,
  "platform": "WINDOWS"}</code></pre>


<h4>Step 2: Start the nodes</h4>

<p>Regardless of whether you want to run a grid with new WebDriver functionality,
 or a grid with Selenium 1 RC functionality,
 or both at the same time,
 you use the same <em>selenium-server-standalone.jar</em> file to start the nodes:

<pre><code>$ java -jar selenium-server-standalone.jar -role node -hub http://localhost:4444</code></pre>

<p>The port defaults to 5555 if not specified whenever
 the <code>-role</code> option is provided and is not hub.
 You can run multiple nodes on one machine but if you do so,
 you need to be aware of your systems memory resources and
 problems with screenshots if your tests take them.


<h5>Configuration of node with options</h5>

<p>As mentioned, for backwards compatibility
 “wd” and “rc” roles are still a valid subset of the “node” role.
 But those roles limit the types of remote connections to their corresponding API,
 while “node” allows both RC and WebDriver remote connections.

<p>Passing JVM properties (using the <code>-D</code> flag
 <em>before the -jar argument</em>)
 on the command line as well,
 and these will be picked up and propagated to the nodes:

<pre><code>-Dwebdriver.chrome.driver=chromedriver.exe</code></pre>


<h5>Configuration of node with JSON</h5>

<p>You can also start grid nodes that are configured
 with a JSON configuration file

<pre><code>$ java -Dwebdriver.chrome.driver=chromedriver.exe -jar selenium-server-standalone.jar -role node -nodeConfig node1Config.json</code></pre>

<p>And here is an example of a <em>nodeConfig.json</em> file:

<pre><code class=json>{
  "capabilities": [
    {
      "browserName": "firefox",
      "acceptSslCerts": true,
      "javascriptEnabled": true,
      "takesScreenshot": false,
      "firefox_profile": "",
      "browser-version": "27",
      "platform": "WINDOWS",
      "maxInstances": 5,
      "firefox_binary": "",
      "cleanSession": true 
    },
    {
      "browserName": "chrome",
      "maxInstances": 5,
      "platform": "WINDOWS",
      "webdriver.chrome.driver": "C:/Program Files (x86)/Google/Chrome/Application/chrome.exe"
    },
    {
      "browserName": "internet explorer",
      "maxInstances": 1,
      "platform": "WINDOWS",
      "webdriver.ie.driver": "C:/Program Files (x86)/Internet Explorer/iexplore.exe" 
    }
  ],
  "configuration": {
    "_comment" : "Configuration for Node",
    "cleanUpCycle": 2000,
    "timeout": 30000,
    "proxy": "org.openqa.grid.selenium.proxy.WebDriverRemoteProxy",
    "port": 5555,
    "host": ip,
    "register": true,
    "hubPort": 4444,
    "maxSessions": 5
  }
}</code></pre>

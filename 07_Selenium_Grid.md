# Selenium Grid

Selenium Grid is a server that allows tests to use web browser instances running on remote machines. With
Selenium Grid, one server acts as the hub. Tests contact the hub to obtain access to browser instances. The
hub has a list of servers that provide access to browser instances (WebDriver nodes), and lets tests use
these instances. Selenium Grid allows to run tests in parallel on multiple machines, and to manage different
browser versions and browser configurations centrally (instead of in each individual test).

## Why Grid?

* Vision of Grid

* Pros of Using Grid
  * scale by distributing tests on several machines ( parallel execution )
  * manage multiple environments from a central point, making it easy to run the tests against a vast 
 combination of browsers / OS.
  * minimize the maintenance time for the grid by allowing you to implement custom hooks to leverage 
 virtual infrastructure for instance.
  * if your tests are running on one particular platform, by using a node on another platform you
 effectively have cross platform testing.

* Cons of Using Grid
  * you have no capabilities for user input if your tests want to prompt for input whereas you would if
 your tests ran locally
  * you also need to maintain the health of other computer systems which run your nodes


## What is a Hub and Node?

* Hub
	* Hub is a central point from where your tests will be kicked off.
	* There will be only one Hub in a grid and it is launched from one system.

* Node
	* Nodes are the different selenium instances that will execute your tests in a distributed manner.
	* There can be many nodes in a grid.
	* The machines which are nodes need not to be the same platform as that of hub.


## Setting Up Your Own

You could use an online service, such as "Sauce Labs" or "Testing Bot" to run your Grid Nodes, but if you 
would rather run your own on your own hardware then see below.

### Quick Start

This example will show you how to start the Selenium 2 Hub, and register both a WebDriver node and a Selenium 1 RC legacy node. Weâ€™ll also show you how to call the grid from Java. The hub and nodes are shown here running on the same machine, but of course you can copy the selenium-server-standalone to multiple machines.

    Note: The selenium-server-standalone package includes the Hub, WebDriver, and legacy RC needed to 
    run the grid. Ant is not required anymore. You can download the selenium-server-standalone-*.jar 
    from http://code.google.com/p/selenium/downloads/list. This walk-through assumes you already have
    Java installed.

#### Step 1: Start the Hub

The Hub is the central point that will receive all the test request and distribute them the the right nodes.

Open a command prompt and navigate to the directory where you copied the selenium-server-standalone 
file. Type the following command:

    java -jar selenium-server-standalone-2.14.0.jar -role hub

The hub will automatically start-up using port 4444 by default, among its other defaults. You can view the
status of the hub by opening a browser window and navigating to: http://localhost:4444/grid/console

###### Configuration of Hub with options

To change the default port, you can add the optional parameter -port when you run the command. Also, any
of the other options you see in the JSON config file (below) are possible.

###### Configuration of Hub with JSON

You certainly can get by with only the simple command show above, but if you need more advanced
configuration, then you can specify a JSON format config file to configure the Grid Hub when you
start it.  You can do it like so:

    java -jar %JAR% -role hub -hubConfig hubConfig.json -debug

And here is an example of a hubConfig.json file:
```javascript
{
    "_comment" : "Configuration for Hub - hubConfig.json",
    "host": ip,
    "maxSessions": 5,
    "port": 4444,
    "cleanupCycle": 5000,
    "timeout": 300000,
    "newSessionWaitTimeout": -1,
    "servlets": [],
    "prioritizer": null,
    "capabilityMatcher": "org.openqa.grid.internal.utils.DefaultCapabilityMatcher",
    "throwOnCapabilityNotPresent": true,   
    "nodePolling": 180000,
    "platform": "WINDOWS"
}

```


#### Step 2: Start the nodes

Regardless on whether you want to run a grid with new WebDriver functionality, or a grid with 
Selenium 1 RC functionality, or both at the same time, you use the same selenium-server-standalone
jar file to start the nodes.

    java -jar selenium-server-standalone-2.14.0.jar -role node -hub http://localhost:4444/grid/register
    
The port defaults to 5555 if not specified whenever the "-role" option is provided and is not hub.  You 
can run multiple Nodes on one machine but if you do so, you need to be aware of your systems memory
resources and problems with screenshots if your tests take them.

###### Configuration of Node with options

For backwards compatibility "wd" and "rc" roles are still a valid subset of the "node" role. But 
those roles limit the types of remote connections to their corresponding API, while "node" allows 
both RC and WebDriver remote connections.

You can pass JVM "-D" properties to the Java process on the command line as well: 
```text
-Dwebdriver.chrome.driver=chromedriver.exe
```

###### Configuration of Node with JSON

You can also start Grid Nodes that are configured with a JSON configuration file.

    java.exe -jar %JAR% -role node -nodeConfig node1Config.json -Dwebdriver.chrome.driver=%CHROMEDRIVER%
    
And here is an example of a node1Config.json file:

```javascript
{
    "capabilities":
    [
        {
            "browserName": "firefox",
            "acceptSslCerts": true,
            "javascriptEnabled": true,
            "takesScreenshot": false,
            "firefox_profile": "",
            "browser-version": "19.0",  
            "platform": "WINDOWS",                     
            "maxInstances": 5
        },
        {
            "browserName": "chrome",
            "maxInstances": 5,
            "platform": "WINDOWS"
        },
        {
            "browserName": "internetExplorer",
            "maxInstances": 1,
            "platform": "WINDOWS"
        }
    ],
    "configuration":
    {
        "_comment" : "Configuration for Node",
        "cleanUpCycle": 2000,
        "timeout": 30000,
        "proxy": "org.openqa.grid.selenium.proxy.WebDriverRemoteProxy",
        "port": 5555,
        "host": ip,
        "register": true,
        "hubPort": 4444,
        "maxSessions": 5
    }
}

```
